Kubernetes or Kubernetes cluster. Here are some recipies:\n\nVagrant - OpenShift Origin\nThis is the easiest and fastest way to get started with fabric8 locally.\nAll you need is Vagrant and VirtualBox installed locally.\nCheck out how to Create the Fabric8 Vagrant Image\n\nNative Kubernetes - Kuberentes\nIf you have Kubernetes installed locally, this guide helps you step-by-step how to install fabric8 on it.\n\nGoogle Container Engine - Kubernetes\nGoogle Container Engine (GKE) is a Google hosted Kubernetes platform. There are many other ways to install Kubernetes as listed on the Kubernetes Getting Started page however if you want to get up and running quickly without having to setup infrastructure and run through installations then GKE is a great option.  This guide will help you step-by-step install fabric8 using vanilla Kubernetes hosted on GKE.\n\nNative OpenShift - OpenShift Origin\nIf you have OpenShift V3 installed locally, this guide helps you step-by-step how to install fabric8 on it.\n\nCDK - Using the Red Hat Container Development Kit\nYou will need is Vagrant and VirtualBox installed locally along with a number of prerequisites.\nCheck out Installing Fabric8 inside the CDK Vagrant Image\n\n\nLocal client setup\nFor a smooth developer experience and for using the fabric8 tools a local OpenShift client needs to be setup.\nHow this is done is described in this recipe.\nWhat&#39;s next\n\nRun a fabric8 App\nCheck out the Quickstarts\nLearn how to develop applications locally\nRunning a quickstart on the iPaaS\n\nTroubleshooting\nHopefully that will get you started quickly; if you hit any issues check out the FAQ, get in touch or raise an issue\nAlso check out the troubleshooting guide\n"},"getStarted/vagrant.html":{"url":"getStarted/vagrant.html","title":"Use Vagrant","body":"Fabric8 Vagrant Image\nThis is the fastest way to get going with Fabric8 and OpenShift on your laptop.\nHere is a video walking you through these steps\n\n  \n      \n  \n\n\n\nHow to vagrant up\n\nDownload and install VirtualBox\nDownload and install Vagrant\n\nNow clone the\nfabric8 installer git repository\nrepository and type these commands:\n$ git clone https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8-installer.git\n$ cd fabric8-installer/vagrant/openshift\n\nDepending on your host operating system you need to install an\nadditional vagrant plugin:\n\nvagrant plugin install landrush for Linux and OS X\nvagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager for Windows\n\nThe next steps are needed for proper routing from the host to\nOpenShift services which are exposed via routes:\n\nLinux: Setup a dnsmasq DNS proxy locally. The detailed\nprocedure depends on the Linux distribution used.  Here is the\nexample for Ubuntu:\n  sudo apt-get install -y resolvconf dnsmasq\n  sudo sh -c &#39;echo &quot;server=/vagrant.f8/127.0.0.1#10053&quot; &gt; /etc/dnsmasq.d/vagrant-landrush&#39;\n  sudo service dnsmasq restart\n\nWindows: Unfortunately for Windows no automatic routing for new\nservices is possible. You have to add new routes manually to\n%WINDIR%\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts. For your convenience, a set\nof routes for default Fabric8 applications has been pre-added. For\nnew services look for the following line and add your new routes\n(&lt;service-name&gt;.vagrant.f8) to this file on a new line like this:\n  ## vagrant-hostmanager-start id: 9a4ba3f3-f5e4-4ad4-9e80-b4045c6cf2fc\n  172.28.128.4  vagrant.f8 fabric8.vagrant.f8 jenkins.vagrant.f8 .....\n  172.28.128.4  myservice.vagrant.f8\n  ## vagrant-hostmanager-end\n\nOS X: Nothing has to be done. OS X will automatically resolve\nall routes to *.vagrant.f8 to your Vagrant VM. This is done via OS\nX&#39;s resolver feature (see man 5 resolver for details).\n\n\nNow startup the Vagrant VM.\nvagrant up\n\nNote the vagrant image is by default configured with 2 CPU cores and\n4 gigs of memory. It is recommended to not exceed about half of your\nmachine’s resources. In case you have plenty of resources on your\nmachine you can increase the settings by editing the\nVagrantfile. The settings are defined in the bottom of the file:\nv.cpus = 2\n\nTo update the RAM you can use an environment variable. For example to run the cd-pipeline application we recommend about 8Gb of RAM:\nexport FABRIC8_VM_MEMORY=8192\nThen follow the on screen instructions.\n\nYou should now have a running vagrant image running at IP address\n172.28.128.4 or at vagrant.f8\nDownloading the docker images may take a few minutes so you might\nwant to jump ahead to the Local Setup recipe then\ncoming back here when you&#39;re done.\nAfter the vagrant box is created and docker images are downloaded,\nthe fabric8 console should appear at\nhttp://fabric8.vagrant.f8/\nWhen you first open your browser Chrome will say:\n  Your connection is not private\n\nYou will want to accept the self signed cert, follow\nthese steps and return here\n\nEnter admin and admin\nYou should now be in the main fabric8 console!

Try these espcially for  secrets to get the pipeline to work with GOGS. \n\n\n\nSetting up your local machine\nIn order to communicate with the Vagrant VM from you localhost it is\nrecommended to install the OpenShift client\ntools. This is explained in an extra document.\nThis is also useful using the\nfabric8 maven tooling or reusing the docker\ndaemon inside vagrant; so that all images built are accessible inside\nthe OpenShift environment.\nAlternatively you can log into the Vagrant VM also via vagrant\nssh. The OpenShift tools (oc, oadmn) are installed in the VM,\ntoo.\nTrying a fresh image\nNote: in case you already ran the above and want to update to the\nlatest vagrant image, OpenShift and Fabric8 release you need to\ndestroy and recreate the vagrant image.  You can do that using:\nvagrant destroy -f\ngit pull\nvagrant up\n\nTroubleshooting\nCheck out the troubleshooting guide for more help.\n"},"getStarted/kubernetes.html":{"url":"getStarted/kubernetes.html","title":"Use Kubernetes","body":"Getting started with Kubernetes\nFirst you wiil need a Kubernetes cluster to play with.

Before you start you should read the short GKE overview and especially familiarise yourself with the pricing information!\nBefore you begin\nTo start you will need to sign up for an account, enable billing and install on your local machine the gcloud and kubectl client binaries.  All this can be done by following the Google before you begin guide.\nTo make things easier to type we use we&#39;ve been using an alias pointing to where the google-cloud-sdk was downloaded for kubectl so we can just call kc..\nalias kc=~/google-cloud-sdk/bin/kubectl\nCreating a container cluster\nNow you are ready to create a cluster on GKE.

You can easily build up the cluster later.\nFollow this guide to create your cluster creating a container cluster\nAgain to start with we recommend choosing a low spec machine such as n1-standard-1 (1 vCPU, 3.75 GB memory).\n\nNow that you have created your cluster you should be able to use your kc alias from the &quot;Before you begin step&quot; above to interact with your new Kubernetes instance, for example..\nkc get pods\nInstall the fabric8 console\nNow there wont be anything running yet so lets install the fabric8 console, run as a replication controller and include a service.  We will also install another pod that includes a base set of template apps that we can run later.  So now run..\nkc create -f http://central.maven.org/maven2/io/fabric8/apps/console-kubernetes/2.2.104/console-kubernetes-2.2.104-kubernetes.json\nTo explain what just happened a little, we downloaded a kubernetes.json configuration file which describes a replication controller for the fabric8-console docker image.  This file is generated as part of the fabric8 release process.  The kubernetes CLI created this replication controller called fabric8 which then instructed the API server to schedule a pod on a node in our cluster.  The image may take a little while to download from docker hub.  If you want to build and push the image to your Google registry then see the relevant section below.\nUsing the console\nHere is a video showing you what you can do with the console on GKE\n\n  \n      \n  \n\n\nFor more details check the console documentation\nAccessing the API server from your local machine\nIn the short term (we&#39;re working on an improved way to access the console) we can view the console using the Kubernetes API server, service proxy.\nAfter we logged in earlier using gcloud beta container get-credentials it created a config file in your user home directory...\ncat ~/.kube/config\nin here you can see the API server address under server: whis we will use later in this step when we refer to $API_SERVER_IP.  Currently the API server uses basic auth to authenticate so at the bottom of the ~/.kube/config file you will also see the admin username and password that you can use.\nYou will then be able to access the API server from you browser after accepting the certificate, for example to view the Kubernetes swagger UI...\nhttps://$API_SERVER_IP/swagger-ui\nnow to view the fabric8 console go to...\nhttps://$API_SERVER_IP/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/default/services/fabric8/\n\nContainer Registry\nYour GKE project has a container registry that you can use to push images to and reference in you kubernetes configurations.

Because of this you don&#39;t need to use a docker registry; a docker daemon \nis kinda like a local registry anyway - provided you don&#39;t try to push or pull the image! \n\nNOTE  you need to make sure that your Kubernetes JSON uses the imagePullPolicy of PullIfAbsent \n(via the maven property fabric8.imagePullPolicy); as any attempt to pull an image just built locally that \nisn&#39;t pushed to a docker registry won&#39;t work; since the image isn&#39;t public yet. In fabric8 2.2.101 the default in \nmvn fabric8:json is to now omit this value which means it uses the Kubernetes default which is PullIfAbsent.\n\nYou now should be able to build and use docker images locally  without pushing or pulling.\nFollow these steps:\n\nDownload the recent OpenShift release binaries for your platform\nunpack the tarball and put the binaries on your PATH\nSet the following environment variables\n\nUnix flavored OSs:\n  export KUBERNETES_DOMAIN=vagrant.f8\n  export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://vagrant.f8:2375\n\nWindows:\n  set KUBERNETES_DOMAIN=vagrant.f8\n  set DOCKER_HOST=tcp://vagrant.f8:2375\n\n\nIt is probably a good idea to add this into your ~/.profile (Linux, OS X) or System -&gt; Advance System Settings -&gt; Environment Variables (Windows)\n\n\n\nNow login to OpenShift via this command:\n\noc login https://172.28.128.4:8443\n\n\nEnter admin and admin for user/password\n\nOver time your token may expire and you will need to re-authenticate via:\noc login\n\nNow to see the status of the system:\noc get pods\n\nor you can watch from the command line via one of these commands:\nwatch oc get pods\noc get pods --watch\n\nHave fun!

So its useful to avoid that step when working locally as it speeds up your edit -&gt; compile -&gt; run cycle time and helps you develop faster.\nSo if you are running Kubernetes locally on your laptop such as via the Fabric8 vagrant image its a good idea to use the same docker daemon that is running inside vagrant on your host operating system (OS X / Windows) when using the docker command and building images.\nSetup your machine\nSet this environment variable if you use the Fabric8 vagrant image:\nexport DOCKER_HOST=tcp://vagrant.f8:2375\nAnd don&#39;t define any of the other docker env vars like DOCKER_CERT_PATH or DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY.\nNow when in a shell on your host (OS X / Windows) you can type docker ps and the output is the same as if you type the same command inside the vagrant ssh shell inside the vagrant VM.\nThis then means that your host (OS X / Windows) will use the same docker daemon as the Kubernetes running inside the fabric8 vagrant image.

In fabric8 2.2.101 the default in mvn fabric8:json is to now omit this value which means it uses the kubernetes default which is PullIfAbsent.\nBuild and apply\nSo in a Maven project type the following:\nmvn install docker:build fabric8:json fabric8:apply\nThis will then build the docker image - in the fabric8 vagrant image - and then generate and apply the kubernetes JSON. This should then run your application on kubernetes. Kubernetes should not need to try pull the image from anywhere since its local in the docker daemon and it should startup fine.\nIf it doesn&#39;t try to start up - or you see it keep retrying from the openshift logs - then there could be an issue with your docker image or code. So its a good idea to try just run it yourself on the console.\ndocker run -itP imageName\nIdeally passing in the environment variables your image needs to discover other services. There&#39;s a handy command, mvn fabric8:create-env to figure out the env vars for you so that you can run docker images outside of kubernetes as if they are inside (in terms of service discovery and environment variables defined in the kubernetes json).\nApply new images faster\nRather than doing the whole regeneration of the JSON and reapplying (which is fairly fast but can take a couple of seconds) and doing a docker push/pull (which can take many seconds) you can just do:\nmvn install docker:build fabric8:delete-pods\nFor more background see a description of the mvn fabric8:delete-pods command.\nWhat this does is builds the docker image in the docker daemon and deletes all the pods in kubernetes which use the same image as your current maven project; this immediately causes the kubernetes Replication Controller to recreate any of the pods you deleted. \nBasically this causes an immediate rolling upgrade to the new image!

Ideally each Microservice should also be elastic so that you can easily scale up or down the number of containers used for each Microservice. Some Microservices may only require one container; others may require many.\n Many times when considering elasticity, you have to consider whether your app is stateless or stateful. Stateless apps should be trivial to scale up and down, however stateful apps require more care. For example, a stateful data store would need to shard and replicate its state across the members in the cluster and know how to rebalance itself during scaling events.\nFabric8 solves these elasticity and resilience problems by using Kubernetes Replica Sets (which used to be called Replication Controllers). Just like most configurations for Kubernetes, a Replica Set is a way to reconcile a desired state: you tell Kubernetes what state the system should be and Kubernetes figures out how to make it so. A Replica Set controls the number of replicas or exact copies of the app that should be running at any time.    \nA Replia Set defines a template for running on or more pods which then can be scaled either by an operator or automatically by Kubernetes based on some system high watermarks.\nThe Replica Set uses a selector to keep watching the available pods matching the selectors labels. If there are not enough pods running it will spin up more; or if there are too many pods running it will terminate the extra pods.\nOperator-based scaling\nTo scale your Replica Set you just need to specify how many replicas you wish by default in your Replica Set YAML file. The default value of 1 should ensure that there is always a pod running. If a pod terminates (or the host running the pod terminates) then Kubernetes will automatically spin up another pod for you.\nAutoscaling\nTo autoscale you need to annotate your Replica Set with the metadata required, such as CPU limits or custom metrics so that Kubernetes knows when to scale up or down the number of pods. Then you can create a HorizontalPodAutoscaler to let Kubernetes know certain pods/ReplicaSets should participate in autoscaling. \n"},"develop/designForFailure.html":{"url":"develop/designForFailure.html","title":"Design for Failure","body":"Design for failure\nTraditionally we&#39;ve tried to &quot;avoid&quot; failure by doing whatever we could to make services/components &quot;not fail&quot;. We would deploy monolithic &quot;appliances&quot; (hardware or software) and if that appliance failed it was a significant event. As we start to move toward distributed systems, especially Microservices, we find that there are many more points of failure. Microservices are  implemented as a collection of services that evolve independently and interact and react to their surrounding environments including the changing of user/customer behaviors, business strategy/direction, system behavior, and even other services. One premise of these types of complex-adaptive systems is the ability to withstand failures and unexpected faults.\nTo do this, you must design your services with failure in mind. There are a handful of practices that come to mind:\n\nmaximize service availability\nself healing\nisolate the &quot;blast radius&quot; of any single failure\ncontinually prove your system has been designed for failure\n\nMaximize service availability\nWe know services individually can fail or be removed from a cluster for any number of reasons. We&#39;d like for clients to have many options for connecting to a service so we run many replicas of them as described in Elasticity and Resilience. When services fail, or are removed from the cluster, we also want to maximize the ability to failover from a client perspective. For this we rely on Service Discovery. With both of those concepts in place we can simply rely  on the infrastructure to maximize the availability of our services.\nSelf healing\nAnother critical pattern of a Microservices environment is to enable self healing. If services fail, do we need manual intervention? Ideally the system would be able to identify faults and correct them. The simplest way to correct a faulty service is to just kill it and restart. Kubernetes provides this type of ability for us with Liveness and Health checks. When liveness or health checks run, and they find that a system is not in a healthy state, the service will be killed. Combined with ReplicaSets, Kubernetes will restore the service to maintain the desired number of replicas Fabric8 has tooling for enabling liveness and health checks by default when we deploy our services.\nIsolate blast radius of failures\nWhen services on which we depend (other Microservices, databases, message queues, caches, etc) start experiencing faults we need to be able to limit the extent of that damage so it doesn&#39;t cause cascading failures. The first step for doing this starts at the application level. Tools like Netflix Hystrix provide bulkheading and within Fabric8 we can use kubeflix project.  Hystrix within the Kubeflix project allows us to:\n\nlimit the number of callers affected by this failure\nshed load with circuit breakers\nlimit the number of calls to a predefined set of threads that can withstand failures\nput a cap on how long a caller can assume the service is still working (timeouts on service calls). without these limits, latency can make calls think the service is still functioning fine and continue sending traffic potentially further overwhelming the service. \nvisualize this in a dynamic environment where services will be coming and down, potentially alleviating or amplifying faults\n\nFrom the domain perspective, we have to be able to degrade gracefully when these downstream components are faulting. We can limit the blast radius of a faulting component, but if we provide a service, how do we maintain our promise to deliver that service? Hystrix also allows us to use fallback methods and workflows to provide some level of (possibly degraded) service even in the event of failures.\nProve your system has been designed for failure\nWhen you&#39;ve designed your system with failure in mind and able to withstand faults, a useful technique is to continuously prove whether or not this is true. With fabric8, we have an out of the box chaos monkey that can go through your Kubernetes namespaces and randomly kill pods in any of your environments including production. If you&#39;ve not designed your services to be able to withstand these types of faults, then you want to know with fast feedback. Chaos monkey can provide that feedback. \n"},"develop/serviceDiscovery.html":{"url":"develop/serviceDiscovery.html","title":"Service Discovery","body":"Service Discovery\nServices are implemented by one or more pods for Elasticity and Resilience. In the cloud pods can come and go when there are hardware failures or when pods get rescheduled onto different nodes to improve resource utilisation.\nTo use a service you need to dynamically discover the pods implementing the service so that you can invoke it. This is called service discovery.\nKubernetes Service Discovery\nThe default way to discover the pods for a kubernetes service is via DNS names. \nService discovery via DNS\nFor a service named foo-bar you can just hard code the host name foo-bar in your application code.\ne.g. to access a HTTP URL use http://foo-bar/ or for HTTPS use  https://foo-bar/ (assuming the service is using the port 80 or 443 respectively). \nIf you use a non standard port number, say, 1234, then append that port number to your URL such as http://foo-bar:1234/.\nNote that DNS works in kubernetes by resolving to the service named foo-bar in the namespace of your pods so you don&#39;t have to worry about configuring your application with environment specific configuration or worry about accidentally talking to the production service when in a testing environment!  You can then move your application (its docker image and kubernetes metadata) into any environment and your application works without any changes!\nService discovery via environment variables\nKubernetes uses 2 environment variables to expose the fixed IP address and port that you can use to access the service.\nSo for a service named foo-bar you can use these 2 environment variables to access the service:\n\nFOO_BAR_SERVICE_HOST is the host (IP) address of the service\nFOO_BAR_SERVICE_PORT is the port of the service\n\ne.g. you could access a web site or service via:\nhttp://${FOO_BAR_SERVICE_HOST}:${FOO_BAR_SERVICE_PORT}/\nThe value of the host and port are fixed for the lifetime of the service; so you can just resolve the environment variables on startup and you&#39;re all set!\nUnder the covers Kubernetes will load balance over all the service endpoints for you.\nNote a pod can terminate at any time; so its recommended that any network code should retry requests if a socket fails; then kubernetes will failover to a pod for you.\nUsing Ribbon\nIf you are using Java to implement your Microservice then you can use Ribbon from NetflixOSS to perform process local load balancing over the available endpoints.\nWe recommend using Kubernetes Service Discovery via DNS (see above) by default because:\n\nit works for services using any network protocols based on TCP and UDP\nit works for any Microservice language implementation\napart from a String change, it typically has minimal impact on the code of your Microservice.\n\nHowever using Ribbon means that your Java code has an in memory model of the available endpoints you could invoke; which lets you plugin your own custom load balancing logic into your Microservice.\n"},"develop/loadBalancing.html":{"url":"develop/loadBalancing.html","title":"Load balancing","body":"Load Balancing\nWhen you have one or more pods implementing a service then you need to load balance requests across them.\nWhen your Microservice is running inside Kubernetes then the service discovery automatically takes care of load balancing across the available pods for you.\nHowever if your Microservice exposes a web application or API which is intended to be used by users or Microservices hosted outside of the Kubenretes cluster, then you need to expose your Microservice to an external host endpoint.\nTo expose your Microservice you need to create an Ingress resource in Kubernetes which will then implement the external load balancer for you.\n"},"develop/pipelines.html":{"url":"develop/pipelines.html","title":"Pipelines","body":"Pipelines\nTo go faster  developing Microservices its great to automate everything and have a Continuous Deployment pipeline for each Microservice.

But if those application are to be run inside Kubernetes, there will be some additional requirements:\n\nCircuit Breaker discovery\nTurbine Server Docker image\nHystrix Dashboard Docker image\n\nCircuit Breaker Discovery\nIn most cloud environments ip addresses are not known in advanced and kubernetes is no exception. This means that we can&#39;t have Turbine pre-configured with a fixed set of urls but instead we need a discovery mechanism.\nThis mechanism is provided by Kubeflix and it pretty much allows to:\n\nDiscovery all endpoints in the current that have been labeled as hystrix.enabled.\nDefine multiple clusters that are composed by multiple endpoints accross multiple namespaces.\n\nTurbine Server Docker image\nHaving a discovery implementation for turbine is not enough. We also need a turbine server app packaged as a docker container and of course the required Kubernetes configuration.\nKubeflix provides both (image and configuration).\nThe image is a simple webapp, pre-configured with the Circuit Breaker discovery as described above. The great thing about this app is that the default configuration can be modified by:\n\nEnvironment Variables\nConfigMap\n\nand that makes it easier for the user to define his own clusters or tune turbine to his own needs.\nHystrix Dashboard Docker image\nFor the Hystrix dashboard we also need to package it as a Docker container and create the required Kubernetes configuration.\nAgain Kubeflix provides both. On top of that web console is configured to reference Turbine Servers DNS name out of the box. \nFor more details, please visit the kubeflix project.\n\nWildfly Swarm Netflix\nTaken directly from the Wildfly Swarm Website:\nSwarm offers an innovative approach to packaging and running JavaEE applications by packaging them with just enough of the server runtime to &quot;java -jar&quot; your application.\nOne of the available modules is Wildfly Swarm Netflix which provides integration with the Netflix components. \nA Hello World example of Hystrix with Wildfly Swarm.    \nIt&#39;s important to note that this example is Kubeflix-ready which means that regardless of how it has been implemented it will be able to integrate with the rest fo the Kubeflix bits. This is also the the case for the next framework in line....\n\nSpring Cloud Netflix\nThis project provides integration between Spring Cloud and the Netflix components, including Hystrix as a Circuit breaker implementation.\nOn top of that it provides integration with Ribbon and makes it easy to compose rest application that communicate with each other.\nFor Spring Cloud users it worths mentioning Spring Cloud Kubernetes that provides Kubernetes integration with Spring cloud and it allows you to use everything together (Spring Cloud, Kubernetes, Netflix components).\n"},"develop/configuration.html":{"url":"develop/configuration.html","title":"Configuration","body":"Configuration\nAs developers we usually try to make the software we create easy to configure so that it can be used in any environment.\nHowever building Microservices on the cloud changes our approach to configuration since you no longer need to configure the following differently for each environment:\n\nfile locations: since docker images have the same file system layout whatever the environment\nservice locations: instead use service discovery\nsecrets like usernames and passwords: instead use kubernetes secrets\n\nSo it turns out that many Microservices no longer need any configuration values which change for different environments thanks to the above!\nThis helps reduce possible errors; it means most configuration for your Microservice can be included inside the docker image and tested in every environment in your CI / CD Pipeline\nHowever for times when you really need to configure things differently on a per environment/deployment basis then here are the main approaches:\nInclude configuration inside the docker image\nThe simplest thing to do with configuration is just include it inside your docker image. e.g. if you are building a Spring Boot Microservice then just include the application.properties or application.yml file inside your src/main/resources folder so that it gets included into your jar and the docker image. This then means that all your configuration gets tested as part of your CI / CD Pipeline\nThis assumes the configuration will be the same in each environment due to the above (using service discovery and kubernetes secrets).\nFor any environment specific values then you could specify environment variables in your kubernetes resource. e.g. your Kubernetes Deployments can include env values in the pod template&#39;s container section.\nThough its good practice maximise the amount of immutable arfifacts you have (e.g. docker images and kubernetes resources) and to minimise the amount of artifacts you need to modify for each environment. So for per-environment configuration we recommend one of the following approaches:\nConfigMap\nKubernetes supports a resource called ConfigMap which is used to store environment specific configuration values - all other configuration values should be inside the docker image as described above.\nYou can then expose the ConfigMap resources either as volume mounts or as environment variables.\nIf you are using Spring in your Java based Microservices you may want to check out the ConfigMap based PropertySource that makes it really easy to load environment specific configurations along with any other configuration included in your docker image.\nGit\nOne of the downsides of using ConfigMap as described above is that there&#39;s no history or change tracking; there&#39;s just the latest version of the ConfigMap. For complex configuration its very useful to have a changelog so you can see who changed what configuration values when so that when things start to go wrong you can easily revert changes or see the history.\nSo you can store your environment specific configuration in a git repository (maybe using a different branch or repo for each environment) then you can mount the git repository as a volume in your Microservice docker container via a gitRepo volume using a specific git revision.\nYou can then use the gitcontroller Microservice to watch the Kubernetes Deployments with one or more gitRepo volumes and it then watches for changes in the associated git repositories and branches.\nWhen there are changes in a configuration git repository the gitcontroller will perform a rolling upgrade of the Kubernetes Deployments to use the new configuration git  revision; or rollback. The rolling upgrade policy (e.g. speed and number of concurrent pods which update and so forth) is all specified by your rolling update configuration in the Deployment specification.\nHere is an example of how to add a gitRepo volume to your application; in this case a spring boot application to load the application.properties file from a git repository.\nYou can either run gitcontroller as a Microservice in your namespace or you can use the gitcontroller binary at any time or as part of your CI / CD Pipeline process.\nChoosing the right approach\nWe recommend you try to keep the environment specific configuration down to a minimum as that increases the amount of resuable immuable artifacts (docker images and kubernetes resources) that can be used without modification in any environment and promotes confidence and testing of those artifacts across your CI / CD Pipeline.\nSo if you can avoid any configuration that is environment specific (thanks to service discovery and kubernetes secrets) then just including configuration inside your docker image makes the most sense.\nWhen you absolutely must have some environment specific configuration then our recommendation is:\n\nif you want history and to be able to see who changes what and when so you can easily audit or revert changes then use git. Otherwise use ConfigMap\n\n"},"fabric8DevOps.html":{"url":"fabric8DevOps.html","title":"Microservices Platform","body":"Fabric8 Microservices Platform\nFabric8 provides a completely integrated open source Microservices Platform which works out of the box on any Kubernetes or OpenShift environment.\nThe entire platform is modular and based on Microservices so you can use as much or as little of Microservices Platform as you wish!

Therefor you need to adjust the authentication on your base platform.\nSo if you are on openshift have a look how to configure authentication.\nGetting Started\nThe console has a number of tabs that let you work with the various Kubernetes resources. We&#39;ll highlight the main ones you&#39;ll need to use:\nControllers\nThe main tab to get a feel for what&#39;s running in your system is the Controllers tab which shows all the replication controllers.\nTo scale up or down a controller to run more or less pods (containers) just increase or decrease the Desired Replicas value and hit Save and hey presto pods are created or destroyed.\n\nOverview\nThe Overview tab gives you a feel for how all the various services and  replication controllers interact:\n\nLibrary\nThe Library tab lets you drag and drop Apps into your library from downloaded App Zips so that you can see all the available applications you can run.

From there you should be able to navigate to the tabs for pods, [replication controllers] and services.\nIf you use the Fabric8 Vagrant approach then the URL is http://fabric8.vagrant.f8/.\nOtherwise you need to find the host name to use.\ne.g. on OpenShift V3 you can find it via:\noc get route fabric8\n"},"cdelivery.html":{"url":"cdelivery.html","title":"CI and CD","body":"Continuous Integration and Continous Delivery\nMicroservices Platform provides a Continuous Integration and Continous Delivery (CI and CD) infrastructure built as a set of Kubernetes resources which are easy to Install.\n\nOverview\nContinuous Integration and Continous Delivery in Microservices Platform consists of the following open source components:\n\nJenkins for Building, Continuous Integration and creating Continuous Delivery pipelines.\nNexus as the artifact repository for caching public artifacts and hosting canary and real release artifacts\nGogs for on premise git repository hosting and GitHub for public hosting\nSonarQube provides a platform to maintain code quality\nChat to support social integration between your teams and the infrastructure\n\nIn addition it adds the following optional capabilities:\n\nJenkins Pipeline Library to help reuse a library of reusable Jenkins Pipeline scripts across projects\nfabric8.yml file as a per project configuration file to tie together the various projects, repositories, chat rooms, workflow script and issue tracker\nChat integration via hubot lets your team embrace devops, have chat notifications of changes to the system and use chat for approval of release promotion\nChaos Monkey to test the resilience of your system by killing pods!\n\nYou can choose to opt in or out of any of the micro services within Microservices Platform; for example use any git repository hosting or Nexus installation. The Chat integration works with hubot so that it can work with any back end chat service such as IRC, Slack, HipChat, Campfire etc.\nBy default we try and integrate all the components closely out of the box so Microservices Platform is an easy, 1 click install. e.g. by default Jenkins builds will use the local Nexus server for all downloads of maven artifacts and for all canary and full releases.\nSince Microservices Platform is built on top of Kubernetes we get an easy way to scale (e.g. Jenkins build slaves) together with letting us reuse Kubernetes services for service discovery to wire up the various components (e.g. for Jenkins to discover Nexus). If you opt out of any of the default implementations; you just need to create a Kubernetes Service pointing to your external installation of the service.\nAutomate Jenkins Jobs\nTeams often have many git repositories with many artifacts and docker container builds. Manually maintaining individual Jenkins build configurations for each git repository can be time consuming and error prone.\nSo we recommend the use of the Jenkins Job DSL to generate the Jenkins build jobs for your projects.\nThe Jenkins app comes with a template parameter SEED_GIT_URL which is the location of the git repository to clone in Jenkins for the Jenkins Job DSL used to generate the Jenkins builds. Any change in that git repository results in the seed job being rerun which then regenerates any of its Jenkins jobs. \nThe SEED_GIT_URL parameter defaults to the value https://github.com/fabric8io/default-jenkins-dsl.git for the default-jenkins-dsl project which provides an example set of scripts to iterate over your projects and create the necessary jobs for them. We hope soon those scripts will automatically setup CI / CD jobs for projects in the hosted Gogs repositories (for now it will iterate over a github organisation and generates builds for matching projects).\nInstallation\nIf you have Apache Maven installed then the following instructions should get you going.\n\ntype oc login to ensure you are logged in and your machine is setup\nset the KUBERNETES_DOMAIN environment variable which if you are running the Fabric8 vagrant image will be:\n\n    export KUBERNETES_DOMAIN=vagrant.f8\n\nif you have run the Fabric8 Continuous Deployment before its a good idea to get the latest console and jenkins images. If this is the first time you are running it you can skip this step (though it does no harm):\n\n    docker pull fabric8/fabric8-console\n    docker pull fabric8/jenkins\n\ntype the following commands\n\n    git clone https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8-installer.git\n    cd fabric8-installer\n    cd cdelivery\n    mvn install\nIf you are running the Fabric8 vagrant image and have setup your local machine&#39;s /etc/hosts file then you should be able to open http://gogs.vagrant.f8/ then click the sign in up link.\nFor now use user gogsadmin and password RedHat$1 as the user and password in gogs (unless you changed the defaults).\n\nNow in the fabric8 console if you click the Projects tab the Repositories sub tab should be available. This prompts you to login to gogs with the user and password (until we can get single sign on working with gogs and OpenShift)\n\nOnce you are logged in the Repositories tab should show a Create Project button on the top right. Click that and try create a project. On the second page of the wizard you get to choose which archetype to use as the start of the project. (If this combo box doesn&#39;t populate first time, its a little bug, go back in your browser and try again ;).\n\nA good start project is the camel-cdi archetype but try any of the archetypes you like the look of. \n\nOnce you click the Execute button the new git repository should be created, the initial code for the project generated from the archetype using the group and artifact IDs and Java package names you picked.\n\nYou should now be able to see the new repository in the Repositories page and browse the repository in gogs via the Browse button and open the editor using the Edit button.\n\nThe create project wizard should also now have triggered the Jenkins Job DSL to generate the CI / CD builds for this new project by triggering the seed build in Jenkins. If you look at the jenkins install - by default at http://jenkins.vagrant.f8 you should see either the seed build running or the new builds created for your project! \n\nNow you might want to setup Chat so that you see chat room notifications of builds and kubernetes resources change.\n\n\nFor more information see Install Fabric8 on OpenShift Guide.\nDemo\nHere is a video demonstrating Fabric8 Continuous Delivery Pipelines\n\n  \n      \n  \n  \n    more details in a blog post\n  \n\n"},"jenkinsWorkflowLibrary.html":{"url":"jenkinsWorkflowLibrary.html","title":"Jenkins Workflow Library","body":"Jenkins Workflow Library\nContinuous Delivery pipelines can be complex; with things like:\n\nasynchronous human or integration test approval which can take days to be achieved\nparallel builds\nfan-in and fan-out of builds\n\nSo to allow flexible Continuous Delivery Pipelines to be defined in a simple script (or DSL) there is an excellent Jenkins plugin called Jenkins Workflow Plugin.\nThe Jenkins Workflow Plugin lets you to define delivery pipelines using concise Groovy scripts which deal elegantly with the persistence and asynchrony involved.\nReusing Workflow Scripts\nYou can add a Jenkins workflow script into your project&#39;s source code to maintain the delivery pipeline and source code together in the same repository.\nHowever teams often have lots of projects which are very similar in nature and copying a groovy script into each project; or into each jenkins workflow job configuration page can soon become maintenance burden.\nSo with Microservices Platform you can configure a reusable library of workflow scripts such as the default Fabric8 workflow library. \nThen you can link each project to the reusable pipeline script that most suits the project.

Its also where messages and clients are moved between brokers, as brokers are spun up and down, depending on load\n\nBroker Control — this monitors the brokers under Fabric8 Messaging’s control and monitors load — and it decides if more ActiveMQ brokers are needed, or less — depending on load.

The gateway is a standalone, highly available, application that sits in between your clients and your APIs that adds governance and metrics to any micro service.\nSome common API Management use-cases are:\n\nQuotas/Rate Limiting : limit the number of requests users or clients are allowed to send to the service.\nSecurity : add security (e.g. BASIC authentication, IP Address white/blacklisting) to your services.\nMetrics : track who is using your services (number of requests), when they use them, and how.\n\nGet started with Apiman\n\nApiman Components - High level components; the apiman management console and the gateway\nGetting Started - Deploying Apiman to Fabric8\nData Model - Introducing the Apiman Data model\nPublish Service - Importing and publishing services to the Apiman gateway\nConsume Service - Consuming services in your Application\n\nTo learn more about its capabilities and how to use it, please\nrefer to the apiman User Guide and other\ntutorial resources on the apiman project site.\n"},"apimanComponents.html":{"url":"apimanComponents.html","title":"Apiman Components","body":"Overview of the components shipped by apiman\nThe bottom half of the apiman component diagram below shows the apiman gateway. The gateway is a standalone application that functions as proxy between service consumers and producers. Requests are routed through a policy engine that applies a preconfigured chain of policies both on the way in (think of authentication policies) as well as on the way out (think of usage policies). Policies are plugins that if needed can connect to external systems to lookup authentication credentials such as LDAP, a JDBC store or a REST based call to an external system. The gateway component services runtime requests. \nThe top half of the diagram show the apiman application itself. This application is used at design time by service producers to configure their service with policies, and or plans. Service consumers then agree to a certain plan and a contract can be set up between the two parties. More on this later. Once the desired policies, plans and contracts are in place, the service can be published to the gateway. The publish process is a REST based call from apiman to the gateway. At this point the service is live for consumption by application developers (service consumers).\n.\nOverview of the apiman components\nApiman on Fabric8\nApiman is deployed on top of Fabric8 itself. This means that both apiman and the gateway are deployed as a Microservice. This means that each app is a Kubernetes Service backed by one of more Kubernetes Pod instances. In each namespace you can run an apiman service and a gateway. Persistence is provided by using elasticsearch as a NoSQL datastore. You can run more then one pod for both apiman and the gateway to increase performance of these apps if needed.\n"},"apimanGettingStarted.html":{"url":"apimanGettingStarted.html","title":"Getting Started","body":"Getting started\nGetting started is easy, you must run the apiman app group:\n\nClick on the Run button on the top right to run apiman \n\nThis app group starts a three applications: &#39;apiman&#39;, &#39;apiman-gateway&#39; and &#39;elasticsearch&#39;. The apiman application provides the Management configuration layer, which consists of a REST layer and a User Interface, the apiman gateway application is the gateway. For the configuration layer and the Gateway to work properly, it will start an elasticsearch service if one wasn&#39;t already running. Elasticsearch is used for persistence by both apiman management app as well as the apiman Gateway, the latter only if you use policies that need to share request count state between pod instances. \nWhen all these applications are running you can see the console at the apiman url \n\nIn the Console click on API Management.\n\nand if you run in vagrant this url would be http://apiman.vagrant, but there are also entries in the menu navigation to get to &#39;API Management&#39;. The apiman dashboard will show. If this is the first time you launch it, please go into the Admin section and check that the bootstrap process loaded the Roles, Policy Definitions and the apiman gateway.\n.\nRoles\n.\nPolicy Definitions\n.\nAPIManGateway\nIn the apiman gateway screen you can click the Test Gateway button to check that apiman can interact with the apiman gateway.\nThe apiman gateway is implemented as a kubernetes service itself. This means that all configuration options for a kubernetes service apply to the gateway as well. If you require loadbalancing you should set &#39;-Dhttp.keepAlive=false&#39; or else it will try to keep connections alive. This in effect means that it only switches on failover.\n"},"apimanDataModel.html":{"url":"apimanDataModel.html","title":"Data Model","body":"Apiman Datamodel\nIt is perhaps most important to understand the various entities used by the API Manager, as well as their relationships with each other.\nOrganizations\nThe top level container concept within the API management project its called the organization. All other entities are managed within the scope of an organization.\nWhen users log into the API management system they must be affiliated with one or more organization. Users can have different roles within that organization allowing them to perform different actions and manage different entities. Please see the User Management section below for more details on this topic.\nWhat an organization actually represents will depend upon who is using API management. When installed within a large enterprise, an organization may represent an internal group within IT (for example the HR group). If installed in the cloud, an organization might represent an external company or organization.\nIn any case, an organization is required before the end user can create or consume services.\nPolicies\nThe most important concept in API management is the policy. The policy is the unit of work executed at runtime in order to implement API governance. All other entities within the API Manager exist in support of configuring policies and sensibly applying them at runtime.\nWhen a request for a Service is made at runtime, a policy chain is created and applied to the inbound request, prior to proxying that request to the back-end API implementation. This policy chain consists of policies configured in the API Manager.\nAn individual policy consists of a type (e.g. authentication or rate limiting) as well as configuration details specific to the type and instance of that policy. Multiple policies can be configured per service resulting in a policy chain that is applied at runtime.\nIt is very important to understand that policies can be configured at three different levels within API management. Policies can be configured on a service, on a plan, or on an application. For more details please see the sections below.\nPlans\nA plan is a set of policies that define a level of service. Whenever a service is consumed it must be consumed through a plan. Please see the section on Service Contracts for more information.\nAn organization can have multiple plans associated with it. Typically each plan within an organization consists of the same set of policies but with different configuration details. For example, an organization might have a Gold plan with a rate limiting policy that restricts consumers to 1000 requests per day. The same organization may then have a Silver plan which is also configured with a rate limiting policy, but which restricts consumers to 500 requests per day.\nOnce a plan has been fully configured (all desired policies added and configured) it must be locked so that it can be used by services. This is done so that service providers can’t change the details of the plan out from underneath the application developers who are using it.\nServices\nA service represents an external API that is being governed by the API management system. A service consists of a set of metadata including name and description as well as an external endpoint defining the API implementation. The external API implementation endpoint includes the type/protocol and the actual endpoint location so that the API can be properly proxied to at runtime.\nIn addition, policies can be configured on a service. Typically, the policies applied to services are things like authentication. Any policies configured on service will be applied at runtime regardless of the application and service contract. This is why authentication is a common policy to configure at the service level.\nServices must be offered through a valid plan configured in the same organization. Service consumers must consume the service through one of those plans. Please see the section on Service Contracts for more information. Note that, alternatively, Services can be marked as &quot;Public&quot;, which means they (once published) can be used by any client, without needing a Contract. To use a public service, simply send requests to the appropriate managed endpoint (through the API Gateway) without providing an API Key.\nOnly once a service is fully configured, including its policies, implementation, and plans can it be published to the runtime gateway for consumption by applications. Once this is done, the service cannot be changed. If changes are required, a new version of the service must be created and configured.\nApplications\nAn application represents a consumer of an API. Typical API consumers are things like mobile applications and B2B applications. Regardless of the actual application implementation, an application must be added to the API management system so that contracts can be created between it and the services it wishes to consume.\nAn application consists of basic metadata such as name and description. Policies can also be configured on an application, but are optional.\nFinally, service contracts can be created between an application and the service(s) it wishes to consume. Once the service contracts are created, the application can be registered with the runtime gateway. Once this registration is complete, the application can no longer be altered. If changes are required, a new version of the application must be created and configured.\nService Contracts\nA service contract is simply a link between an application and a service through a plan offered by that service. This is the only way that an application can consume a service. If there are no applications that have created service contracts with a service, that service cannot be accessed through the API management runtime gateway.\nWhen a service contract is created, the system generates a unique API key specific to that contract. All requests made to the service through the API Gateway must include this API key. The API key is used to create the runtime policy chain from the policies configured on the service, plan, and application.\nService Contracts can only be created between Applications and published Services which are offered through at least one Plan. A Service Contract cannot be created between an Application and a public Service.\nPolicy Chain\nA policy chain is an ordered sequence of policies that are applied when a request is made for a service through the API Gateway. The order that policies are applied is important and is as follows:\n\nApplication\nPlan\nService\n\nWithin these individual sections, the end user can specify the order of the policies.\nWhen a request for a service is received by the API Gateway the policy chain is applied to the request in the order listed above. If none of the policies fail, the API Gateway will proxy the request to the backend API implementation. Once a response is received from the back end API implementation, the policy chain is then applied in reverse order to that response. This allows each policy to be applied twice, once to the inbound request and then again to the outbound response.\n"},"apimanImportService.html":{"url":"apimanImportService.html","title":"Publish Service","body":"Importing a service from Fabric8 and publishing it to the gateway\nLet&#39;s assume you have deployed the CxfCdi quickstart in Fabric8 using\n...\nmvn -Pf8-deploy-local\n...\nfrom the ipaas-quickstarts/quickstart/cdi/cxf directory and that you created your own organization in apiman. You can now navigate to the Organization/Service page to &#39;Import Services&#39; into apiman. Apiman will obtain a list of running services in your namespace that match your search string. Use &#39;*&#39; to match all service. \n.\nGo through the wizzard and select import as &#39;Public Service&#39; as we don&#39;t yet have any Plans or Policies set up. Note that we can add those later if needed. Please notice that after the import is complete, the service has discovered the serviceUrl, serviceType, descriptionUrl and descriptionType. When the service was deployed to Kubernetes the service developer registered this information in Kubernetes using Kubernetes Service Annotations.\nKubernetes Service Annotations\nKubernetes allows the creation of Service Annotations. Here we propose the use of the following annotations\n\n&#39;api.service.kubernetes.io/path&#39; - the path part of the service endpoint url. An example value could be &#39;cxfcdi&#39;,\n\n&#39;api.service.kubernetes.io/protocol&#39; - the protocol of the service. Example values can be &#39;SOAP&#39; or &#39;REST&#39;,\n\n&#39;api.service.kubernetes.io/scheme&#39; - the scheme of service endpoint url which can be &#39;http&#39; or &#39;https&#39; (defaults to &#39;http&#39;)\n\n&#39;api.service.kubernetes.io/description-path&#39; - the path part of the service description document’s endpoint. It is a pretty safe assumption that the service self documents. An example value for a swagger 2.0 document can be &#39;cxfcdi/swagger.json&#39;,\n\n&#39;api.service.kubernetes.io/description-language&#39; - the type of Description Language used. Example values supported by apiman are &#39;WSDL&#39;, &#39;WADL&#39;, &#39;SwaggerJSON&#39;, &#39;SwaggerYAML&#39;.\n\n\nThe fragment below is taken from the service section of the kubernetes.json were these annotations are used\n...\n&quot;objects&quot; : [ {\n  &quot;apiVersion&quot; : &quot;v1&quot;,\n  &quot;kind&quot; : &quot;Service&quot;,\n  &quot;metadata&quot; : {\n    &quot;annotations&quot; : {\n      &quot;api.service.kubernetes.io/path&quot; : &quot;cxfcdi&quot;,\n      &quot;api.service.kubernetes.io/protocol&quot; : &quot;REST&quot;,\n      &quot;api.service.kubernetes.io/description-path&quot; : &quot;cxfcdi/swagger.json&quot;,\n      &quot;api.service.kubernetes.io/description-language&quot; : &quot;SwaggerJSON&quot;\n      &quot;api.service.openshift.io/api-manager&quot; : &quot;apiman&quot;\n  },\n...\nThe fabric8-maven-plugin makes it easy to define these annotations as properties in your project&#39;s pom. Simply add a property that is prefixed with &#39;fabric8.annotations.service.&#39;. In the CdiCxf project mentioned above this looks like\n...\n&lt;fabric8.annotations.service.api.service.kubernetes.io.path&gt;cxfcdi&lt;/fabric8.annotations.service.api.service.kubernetes.io.path&gt;\n&lt;fabric8.annotations.service.api.service.kubernetes.io.protocol&gt;REST&lt;/fabric8.annotations.service.api.service.kubernetes.io.protocol&gt;\n&lt;fabric8.annotations.service.api.service.kubernetes.io.description-path&gt;cxfcdi/swagger.json&lt;/fabric8.annotations.service.api.service.kubernetes.io.description-path&gt;\n&lt;fabric8.annotations.service.api.service.kubernetes.io.description-language&gt;SwaggerJSON&lt;/fabric8.annotations.service.api.service.kubernetes.io.description-language&gt;\n&lt;fabric8.annotations.service.api.service.openshift.io.api-manager&gt;apiman&lt;/fabric8.annotations.service.api.service.openshift.io.api-manager&gt;\n...\nBy convention the part after the prefix is the annotation key, and if the key contains a &#39;.&#39;, everything before that last dot turns into the annotation&#39;s namespace. So, for example, &#39;api.service.kubernetes.io.path&#39; turns into &#39;api.service.kubernetes.io/path in the kubernetes.json.\nPublishing the service to the gateway\nYou may have noticed the use of the annotion &quot;api.service.openshift.io/api-manager&quot; : &quot;apiman&quot;. If this annotation is set it this service will be imported automatically. After the service is imported into the API manager, we can publish it out to the gateway. After publication the service will be ready for use by service consumers. To publish a service, open the service detail page and click the blue &#39;publish&#39; button.\n.\nThe service data is send to the gateway and now the gateway is able to route traffic from the gateway to the internal service. The \ninternal service address is displayed in the &#39;Implementation&#39; tab on the service detail page (http://quickstart-java-cxf-cdi.vagrant.f8/cxfcdi), and the exact gateway address is displayed in the &#39;Endpoint&#39; tab (http://apiman-gateway.vagrant.f8/gateway/Fabric8Org/quickstart-java-cxf-cdi/1.0). The latter is the &#39;managed endpoint&#39; a service consumer would be using.\nApplying a Policy to a &#39;Public Service&#39;\nA service can be published to the gateway without any policies but it makes sense to configure at least an authentication policy. Since we already published the service we can no longer change the settings on this version. So let&#39;s add version 1.1 of this service (clone version 1.0). Now you can navigate to the Policy screen on the Service and select Add Policy. In the dropdown select a Basic Authentication policy, and select &#39;Basic Auth Required&#39; and add a Static Identity and a  user/password pair.\n.\nClick save when done, and now you should see the policy on the &#39;Policy&#39; tab, so go ahead and &#39;Publish&#39; the service. The managed endpoint of this new version of the service is http://apiman-gateway.vagrant.f8/gateway/Fabric8Org/quickstart-java-cxf-cdi/1.1. You can try it in a new browser window and you should see it pop up the basic auth login box.\n"},"apimanConsumeService.html":{"url":"apimanConsumeService.html","title":"Consume a Service","body":"Consuming a service from Fabric8 in your Application\nCreate an Application\nApplication developers that want to consume services can &#39;Create an New Application&#39; from the apiman dashboard screen.

We can do this by listing all the running pods and their state:\noc get pods\nWhat you should see in the list, is a pod with the name of java-fatjar and a random suffix as shown below:\nipaas-quickstarts/quickstart/java/fatjar/$ oc get pods\nNAME                                  READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\ndocker-registry-1-68nz6               1/1       Running   0          6m\nfabric8-jccyj                         1/1       Running   0          7m\nfluentd-elasticsearch-172.28.128.4    1/1       Running   0          5m\njava-fatjar-o8hxg                     1/1       Running   0          9s\nrouter-1-lz02h                        1/1       Running   0          6m\nWe can see our example is running with the pod name java-fatjar-o8hxg\nTo see the logs of the running pod we can type oc logs &lt;name&gt; such as:\noc logs java-fatjar-o8hxg\nThat will dump the logs which can be massive. What you may want to do is to follow the logs using the -f flag, by doing:\noc logs -f java-fatjar-o8hxg\nAnd then the console is updated in real time, you can use ctrl + c to exit the logging.\nUpdating the source code\nWe would now like to update the source code so the application prints a different message to the log, and then redeploy the changed application.\nTo do that we start by changing the source code which you can load into your favorite Java editor, or use a plain text editor as the source code is so simple we can change it without a full blown Java editor.\nThe source code is in the src/main/java/io/fabric8/quickstarts/java/fatjar/Main.java java file, which we change as follows:\npublic class Main {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {\n        while(true) {\n            System.out.println(&quot;I was here: &quot; + randomAlphanumeric(5));\n            SECONDS.sleep(1);\n        }\n    }\n\n}\nNotice we changed the text to be I was here:\nThen we can just deploy the application using the following goal:\nmvn -Pf8-local-deploy\nWhich will clean and compile the source, do a docker image build, and re-deploy to kubernetes.\nWhen the application is de-deployed then kubernetes will shutdown the old pod, and start a new pod, so we will list all the running pods with oc get pods:\nipaas-quickstarts/quickstart/java/fatjar/$ oc get pods\nNAME                                  READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\ndocker-registry-1-68nz6               1/1       Running   0          15m\nfabric8-jccyj                         1/1       Running   0          16m\nfluentd-elasticsearch-172.28.128.4    1/1       Running   0          14m\njava-fatjar-2nnx7                     1/1       Running   0          42s\nrouter-1-lz02h                        1/1       Running   0          15m\nAnd as you can see the pod name has changed to java-fatjar-2nnx7. To see our code change we can show the logs of the pods with:\noc logs -f java-fatjar-2nnx7\nAnd you should see our changed logging message:\nipaas-quickstarts/quickstart/java/fatjar/$ oc logs -f java-fatjar-2nnx7\nI&gt; No access restrictor found, access to all MBean is allowed\nJolokia: Agent started with URL http://172.17.0.7:8778/jolokia/\nI was here: PorTM\nI was here: GT7rh\nI was here: gYQu0\nI was here: hzEoO\nI was here: YEk5a\nDeleting the running quickstart\nKubernetes is designed as a resilliant platform, so for example if for some reason a pod is killed (a node crashes, or something), then the platform is self healing and will spin up a new pod.\nSo if you want to delete the running quickstart, you would either need to scale it down to 0, or delete the replication controlller that is monitoring the pod state and would scale up or down pods depending on your desired state. \nSo what we can do is to delete the controller using\noc delete rc java-fatjar\nThen the pod will automatic be shutdown and deleted as well.\nYou can get a list of all running replication controllers with:\noc get rc\nAnother easy way would be to use the fabric8 web console to delete the quickstat.\nClosing remarks\nYay you made through this first walk through of the most simple quickstart we have. For the next walk lets up the game a bit and use Camel and Kubernetes services.\n"},"tools.html":{"url":"tools.html","title":"Tools","body":"Tools\nFabric8 provides many tools to help you work with Kubernetes and OpenShift\n\nMaven Plugin helps you work with fabric8 and kubernetes from inside maven, your builds and releases\ndocker:build builds the docker image for your maven project\ndocker:push pushes the locally built docker image to the global or a local docker registry\nfabric8:json generates kubernetes json for your maven project\nfabric8:apply applies the kubernetes json into a namespace in a kubernetes cluster\n\n\nJava Libraries provides a number of Java libraries for working with and testing Kubernetes, Docker, etcd, ActiveMQ etc.\nCDI provides an easy way to work with Kubernetes services using the CDI Dependency Injection approach\nTesting helps you perform integration and system tests of your apps on top of Kubernetes\nForge Addons provides a universal command line shell and IDE plugins for working with your projects and fabric8\nQuickStarts provide a really easy way to get started\n\n"},"testing.html":{"url":"testing.html","title":"Testing","body":"Integration and System Testing\nFabric8 supports integration testing of Apps using Kubernetes via fabric8-arquillian which provides an extension for Arquillian.\nUsing this extension you can easily:\n\nApply the kubernetes configuration of your application, including its dependencies.\nWait until pods and services are ready to be used.\nMake created services, replication controllers and kubernetes client available inside your test case (via @ArquillianResource).\n\nfabric8-arquillian uses:\n\nKubnernetes to provision and orchestrate the containers inside a new unique namespace; so that each test case is isolated from other environments and test cases\nArquillian to run the JUnit tests and perform the necessary dependency injection\nkubernetes-assertions and jolokia-assertions to provide assertions within the JUnit test case.\n\nSession, Lifecycle &amp; Labels\nThe kubernetes configuration is applied once per test suite. This means that the environment is getting created once per test suite and then multiple test cases are run against that environment.\nTo encapsulate everything that has been applied to kubernetes as part of the current test suite, the notion of &quot;session&quot; is used.\nIn order to distinguish which pods, services and replication controllers have been created as part of the testing session, anything that is created using the arquillian extension, will be created inside a unique namespace per session.\nThis namespace is also going to be used to cleanup everything after the end of the suite or upon termination of the process.\nThe Session is also made available to the test cases as an arquillian resource (see below).\nKeeping the namespace around\nIf a test fails you may want to look inside the Kubernetes namespace took at the failed pods. By default the namespace gets garbage collected immediately.\nTo delay this you can use these environment variables\n\nFABRIC8_NAMESPACE_CONFIRM_DESTROY set this to &#39;true&#39; to force the user to type &#39;Q&#39; in the command line terminal to terminate the namespace\nFABRIC8_NAMESPACE_DESTROY_TIMEOUT set this to the number of seconds to keep the namespace around for before destroying it\n\nArquillian Resources available to test cases\nA typical integration test, would need to apply the kubernetes configuration, wait for everything to start up and then assert that that expected pods and services are available and of course test the actual services.\nTo do that, the test needs to have access to information like:\n\nPods\nServices\nReplication Controllers\nSession Namespace\n\nEach of the items above is made available to the test as an arquillian resource. \nTo obtain a reference to the KubernetesClient:\n @ArquillianResource\n io.fabric8.kubernetes.api.KubernetesClient client;\nServices\nTo obtain the list of all services created in the current session:\n@ArquillianResource\nio.fabric8.kubernetes.api.model.ServiceList sessionServices;\nTo obtain a reference to a particular service created in the current session:\n@Id(&quot;my-service-id&quot;)\n@ArquillianResource\nio.fabric8.kubernetes.api.model.Service myService;\nReplication Controllers\nTo obtain the list of all replication controllers created in the current session:\n@ArquillianResource\nio.fabric8.kubernetes.api.model.ReplicationControllerList sessionControllers;\nTo obtain a refernce to a particular replication controller created in the current session:\n@Id(&quot;my-controller-id&quot;)\n@ArquillianResource\nio.fabric8.kubernetes.api.model.ReplicationController myController;\nTo obtain the list of all pods created in the current session:\n@ArquillianResource\nio.fabric8.kubernetes.api.model.PodList sessionPods;\nTo obtain the Session:\n @ArquillianResource\n io.fabric8.arquillian.kubernetes.Session mySession;\nConfiguration Options\nAny configuration option can be provided as an environment variable, system property or arquillian property. \nFor example:\n    &lt;arquillian xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;\n                xmlns=&quot;http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian&quot;\n                xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian\n                http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian/arquillian_1_0.xsd&quot;&gt;\n\n        &lt;extension qualifier=&quot;kubernetes&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;property name=&quot;masterUrl&quot;&gt;true&lt;/property&gt;\n        &lt;/extension&gt;\n    &lt;/arquillian&gt;\nThe only required configuration option is url to the kubernetes master. Since in most cases this will be specified as KUBERNETES_MASTER env variable, there is no need\nto specify it again. \nThis means that the arquillian.xml configuration file is completely optional.\nSupported options:\n\nmasterUrl: The url to the kubernetes master.\nconfigFileName: If a url hasn&#39;t been explicitly specified, the configFileName can be used for discovery of the configuration in the classpath.\nconfigUrl: The url to the kubernetes configuration to be tested.\nconnectToServices: Whether or not an attempt is made to connect to a service port; failing the test if it can&#39;t be connected. This is disabled by default since its likely a service PortalIP / port cannot be opened by the JUnit test case (and may require authentication)\ndependencies: A space separated list of directories, files or urls to kubernetes configurations that are required to be applied before the current one.\nwaitForServiceConnection: Wait until a network connection to all applied services is possible.\nserviceConnectionTimeout: The connection timeout for each attempt to &quot;connect to the service&quot;.\nwaitForServices: Explicitly specify which services to wait. If this option is ommitted or empty all services will be waited.\ntimeout: The total amount of time for to wait for pods and service to be ready.\npollInterval: The interval between polling the status of pods and services.\n\nMaven Integration\nIf dependencies have not been explicitly specified, the extension will find all test scoped dependencies and search inside those artifacts for kubernetes.json resources.\nThen it will treat those as dependencies and apply them along with the configuration.\nOne thing to be careful of is that adding test dependencies on kubernetes.json will add transitive dependencies to your test project; so you may want to add exclusions as this example shows.\nExample\nThere are lots of examples in the quickstarts.\nHere is an example Arquillian Fabric8 integration test that tests that an AMQ broker, producer and consumer startup and properly produce and consume messages correctly.\nIn particular here is the code that does JMX assertions via jolokia on the containers that are created by the integration test.\nRequirements\nWhen running an fabric8-arquillian integration test then the environment variable KUBERNETES_MASTER needs to be specified to point to the kubernetes environment in which to create the containers and services.\nAlso you may want to set the KUBERNETES_TRUST_CERTIFICATES variable to allow connection to kubernetes without a client certificatE:\nexport KUBERNETES_TRUST_CERTIFICATES=true\nexport KUBERNETES_MASTER=http://localhost:8443\nNote that this can be any kubernetes environment (a kubernetes installation, OpenShift, RHEL Atomic or GKE). Also note that different integration tests can be running at the same time on the same kubernetes environment.\nIf you find that you are getting exceptions and output of the form:\nWaiting for: SomeException....\nWaiting for: SomeException....\nand if the exception isn&#39;t clear from the message, you could define this environment variable to get an additional full stack trace (which is very noisy but can be handy):\nexport FABRIC8_VERBOSE_ASSERT=true\nAssertion libraries\nThe following libraries are provided to help you create concise assertions using assertj based DSL:\n\nkubernetes-assertions provides a set of assertj assertions of the form assertThat(kubernetesResource) for working with the kubernetes-api\njolokia-assertions makes it easy to perform assertions on remote JVMs via JMX using  Jolokia over HTTP/JSON\nkubernetes-jolokia makes it easy to work with the Jolokia Client API and Java containers running in Pods inside Kubernetes which expose the Jolokia port\n\nAdd it to your Maven pom.xml\nTo be able to use this library add this to your Apache Maven based project add this into your pom.xml\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\n            &lt;groupId&gt;io.fabric8&lt;/groupId&gt;\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;fabric8-arquillian&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n            &lt;version&gt;2.2.101&lt;/version&gt;\n            &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\n"},"forge.html":{"url":"forge.html","title":"Forge","body":"Forge Addons\nfabric8 comes with various JBoss Forge add ons to help improve your developer experience.\nFirst install Forge (requires Forge 3.0 or better) and run it:\nforge\nyou can install the Forge add ons via:\naddon-install --coordinate io.fabric8.forge:camel,2.2.153\naddon-install --coordinate io.fabric8.forge:camel-commands,2.2.153\naddon-install --coordinate io.fabric8.forge:devops,2.2.153\naddon-install --coordinate io.fabric8.forge:kubernetes,2.2.153\nNotice the version number (current 2.2.153) is the fabric8-forge release.

Refer to the Maven Property Reference for more details. \nSpecifying environment variables\nYou can use maven properties to specify environment variables to pass into the generated PodSpec in the ReplicationController as follows...\n&lt;project&gt;\n...\n  &lt;properties&gt;\n    &lt;fabric8.env.FOO&gt;bar&lt;/fabric8.env.FOO&gt;\n    ...\n  &lt;/properties&gt;\n...\n&lt;/project&gt;\nThe above will then be the equivalent in docker terms of running...\ndocker run -d -e FOO=bar ${DOCKER_IMAGE}\nTemplates and parameters\nWhen using OpenShift templates you want to parameterize things so users can more easily configure things. This means using expressions like ${FOO} inside environment variable names or values.\nOne issue with this is that maven properties tend to expand expressions of the form ${FOO} if there is a maven property or environment variable of that name. There is currently no way to escape those expressions inside maven property elements in the pom.xml &lt;properties/&gt; element.\nSo to make it easier to configure environment variables while bypassing maven&#39;s property expansion, you can use a file specified via fabric8.envProperties property which defaults to the file src/main/fabric8/env.properties. \ni.e. if you create a file called src/main/fabric8/env.properties in your project that looks like this\nFOO = bar\nANOTHER = some ${CHEESE}\nIn the above example there will be 2 environment variables defined, FOO and ANOTHER with ANOTHER using a template parameter expression for CHEESE\nNote that you can mix and match both approaches. The nice thing about maven properties is they can be inherited from parent projects. The nice thing about the env.properties file approach is you have more fine grained control over property expansion and dealing better with OpenShift template parameter expressions.\nCombining JSON files\nThe fabric8:json goal generates a kubernetes.json for each maven project which is enabled. Often maven projects are multi-module which means you&#39;ll have lots of fine grained generated kubernetes.json files. This is useful; but you often want to combine files together to make courser grained JSON files that are easier for users to consume. \nAnother advantage of combining the JSON files together is that the fabric8:json goal automatically moves Service objects first; so that if you have cyclical apps which depend on each other, the combined JSON will force the services to be created up front before any Pods to avoid breaking links. (Services must be defined first so that their environment variables become available if using those for service discovery).\nBy default a List of items is created; unless the pom.xml defines any OpenShift template parameters (see Creating OpenShift Templates for more detail) or any of the dependent JSON files are Template. The fabric8:json goal automatically combines OpenShift Templates together; unifying the list of template parameters to create a single combined Template.\nYou can generate a separate JSON file with the dependencies of the current project, use fabric8.combineJson.target property for that. If you want to create a Template of the current project and its dependencies, you can set fabric8.extra.json property to ${fabric8.combineJson.target}, and don’t forget to change the name of the Template (because &quot;Combining JSON files&quot; feature uses the names of templates for filtering duplicate), for example: &lt;fabric8.combineJson.project&gt;${project.artifactId}Combine&lt;/fabric8.combineJson.project&gt;\nExamples\nThe fabric8 project defines a number of different application modules for all the various parts of fabric8.\nIf you enable the fabric8.combineDependencies property then the fabric8:json goal will scan the maven dependencies for any dependency of &lt;classifier&gt;kubernetes&lt;/classifier&gt; and &lt;type&gt;json&lt;/type&gt; and combine them into the resulting JSON. \nSee this example to see how we can configure this in a pom.xml.\nMaven Properties\nYou can use maven properties to customize the generation of the JSON:\nYou define the maven properties in the pom.xml file using the &lt;properties&gt; tag such as:\n    &lt;properties&gt;\n      &lt;fabric8.label.container&gt;java&lt;/fabric8.label.container&gt;\n      &lt;fabric8.label.group&gt;myapp&lt;/fabric8.label.group&gt;\n      &lt;fabric8.iconRef&gt;camel&lt;/fabric8.iconRef&gt;\n    &lt;/properties&gt;\nIf you wish to override or add a property from the command line, you can do this by using Java JVM system properties. A property from the command line will override any existing option configured in the pom.xml file. For example to add a 3rd label and change the icon, you can do:\nmvn fabric8:json -Dfabric8.label.foo=bar -Dfabric8.iconRef=java\nThere are many options as listed in the following table:\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\n\n\ndocker.image\nUsed by the docker-maven-plugin to define the output docker image name.\n\n\nfabric8.json.target\nThe generated kubernetes JSON file.

For example, @KubernetesProvider(&quot;foo.json&quot;) will generate the previous manifest as target/classes/foo.json:\n@KubernetesProvider(&quot;foo.json&quot;)\npublic KubernetesList create() {\n    return new KubernetesListBuilder()\n            .addNewReplicationControllerItem()\n                .withNewMetadata()\n                    .withName(&quot;Hello-Controller&quot;)\n                .endMetadata()\n                .withNewSpec()\n                    .withReplicas(1)\n                    .addToSelector(&quot;component&quot;, &quot;my-component&quot;)\n                    .withNewTemplate()\n                        .withNewSpec()\n                            .addNewContainer()\n                                .withName(&quot;my-container&quot;)\n                                .withImage(&quot;my/image&quot;)\n                            .endContainer()\n                        .endSpec()\n                    .endTemplate()\n                .endSpec()\n            .endReplicationControllerItem()\n            .build();\n}    \n@KubernetesProvider annotation can also generate YAML files. When you give the file a name as in above, and you use an\nextension of .yaml or .yml, the processor will automatically generate YAML for you. \nSo what is the benefit of using java instead of json? The most noteworthy are:\n\nType Safety\nDynamic generation of JSON\nTooling support (IDEs etc)\n\nAnd what are the benefits over using the Maven Plugin?\n\nNo limitation to the structure or the number of the generated items.\nDoesn&#39;t require maven. Can be used with gradle or even directly with the java compiler.\n\nManipulating existing Kubernetes Resources\nThere are cases, where you need to modify an existing Kubernetes resource instead of generating one from scratch. Cases like this can be:\n\nAdding a service\nAdding/Removing labels to selectors\nAdding/Removing a container to a pod\n\nDue to the deep nesting of those objects, any kind of manipulation is not trivial and requires to know exactly how to navigate the object/json graph.\nTo make this task simpler all the builders objects that are used to model the Kubernetes resources support the &quot;Visitor Pattern&quot; and Fabric8 offers annotations that\nmake it very easy to use them.\nThe @KubernetesModelProcessor can be added to any Java Class that is intended to manipulate an existing kubernetes json file.\nUpon compilation the annotation processor will look for all methods in the class that accept as argument a builder object of a Kubernetes resource (e.g. A Pod, a Service, a ReplicationController etc).\nThen it will navigate through all the elements to the existing json file and for each element will invoke all matching methods.\nFor example:\n&quot;We want to add a key/pair to all replica selectors&quot;\n@KubernetesModelProcessor\npublic class ManipulationExample {\n    public void on(ReplicationControllerSpecBuilder builder) {\n        builder.addToSelector(&quot;mykey&quot;,&quot;myvalue&quot;);\n    }\n}\nAn other example can be &quot;Add a container to all pods&quot;\n@KubernetesModelProcessor\npublic class ManipulationExample {\n    public void on(PodTemplateSpecBuilder builder) {\n        builder.withNewSpec()\n                .addNewContainer()\n                    .withName(&quot;my-container)\n                    .withImage(&quot;my/image&quot;)\n                .endContainer()\n        .endSpec();\n    }\n}\nYou can also manipulate existing kubernetes resources with a specific file name by passing in the file name to the @KubernetesModelProcessor\nannotation like this:\n@KubernetesModelProcessor(&quot;foo.json&quot;)\npublic class ManipulationExample {\n    public void on(PodTemplateSpecBuilder builder) {\n        builder.withNewSpec()\n                .addNewContainer()\n                    .withName(&quot;my-container)\n                    .withImage(&quot;my/image&quot;)\n                .endContainer()\n        .endSpec();\n    }\n}\nIn many cases we would want to apply a change not to &quot;ALL&quot; items of a particular type, but to some or to a specific one.\nFor this purpose the annotation processor used the @Named annotation (javax.inject.Named) to specify the name of element we want to manipulate.\nThe last example could use the @Named annotation to specify the name of the replication controller.\n@KubernetesModelProcessor\npublic class ManipulationExample {\n\n    @Named(&quot;my-controller&quot;)\n    public void on(ReplicationController builder) {\n        builder.withNewSpec()\n                    .withNewTemplate(builder.getSpec().getTemplate())\n                        .addNewContainer()\n                            .withName(&quot;my-container)\n                            .withImage(&quot;my/image&quot;)\n                        .endContainer()\n                    .endTemplate()\n                .endSpec();\n        }\n    }\nUsing the @Named annotation we specified that we want this method to be applied to all replication controllers that are named &quot;my-controller&quot;.\nThen starting from the replication controller of our choice we performed the desired manipulation (added a new container).\nPerforming manipulation on resources generated by the maven plugin.\nIn some cases it may be handy to generate the skeleton of the json file using the Maven Plugin and then apply minor modifications (for fine tuning) using the annotation processors.\nIt is important to remember that the maven plugin is using as default maven phase the &quot;generate-resources&quot;, while the annotation processors are using the compile phase.\nThis makes possible doing something like:\n    mvn clean fabric8:json compile\nThis will cause the maven plugin to generate the kubernetes.json file during the &quot;generated-sources&quot; and if a valid @KubernetesModelProcessor is found in the sources, it will be used modify the generated kubernetes.json file.\n"},"mavenFabric8Recreate.html":{"url":"mavenFabric8Recreate.html","title":"fabric8:recreate","body":"fabric8:recreate\nThe maven fabric8:recreate goal takes the JSON file generated via mvn fabric8:json located at target/classes/kubernetes.json and applies it to the current Kubernetes environment and namespace creating all resources which don&#39;t exist and recreates any resources which do exist. \nThis goal is short hand for \nmvn fabric8:apply -Dfabric8.recreate=true\nSee the  fabric8:apply goal for more details on the available properties\n"},"mavenFabric8Rolling.html":{"url":"mavenFabric8Rolling.html","title":"fabric8:rolling","body":"fabric8:rolling\nThe maven fabric8:rolling goal takes the JSON file generated via mvn fabric8:json located at target/classes/kubernetes.json and applies it to the current Kubernetes environment and namespace creating all resources which don&#39;t exist and performing a rolling update of any replication controllers which already  exist. \nThis goal is short hand for \nmvn fabric8:apply -Dfabric8.rolling=true\nSee the  fabric8:apply goal for more details on the available properties\n"},"helm.html":{"url":"helm.html","title":"Helm","body":"Helm\nHelm is a really cool way to install and upgrade applications on Kubernetes.

So it can be used safely in kubernetes and hybrid deployments for easier consumption of kubernetes managed services.\nThe @ServiceName annotation\nIn kubernetes, each service has a host and a port and they are passed to container as environment variable. Containers that live inside Kubernetes\ncan lookup for services using their environment variables. Application that live outside of kubernetes need to use the kubernetes API in order to perform lookups.\nThe fabric8 extension provides a unified approach in looking up for service coordinates. It provides the @ServiceName qualifier which can be used to inject the coordinates as a String or as a URL by just referring to the id of the service.\n@Inject\n@ServiceName(&quot;my-service&quot;)\nprivate String service.\nThe @Protocol annotation\nKubernetes uses the notion of Protocol to refer to the transport protocol TCP or UDP. In Java URL its more useful to use the application protocol.\nOne could find and replace the transport protocol with the actual application protocol but that its really smelly.\nThe CDI extension supports the @Protocol annotation which allows the user to specify the application protocol to use.\n    @Inject\n    @ServiceName(&quot;my-ftp-service&quot;)\n    @Protocol(&quot;ftp&quot;)\n    private String service.\nThe @PortName annotation\nIn Kubernetes a service may define multiple ports. Fabric8 provides a qualifier which can be used to select a specific port by name.\n    @Inject\n    @ServiceName(&quot;my-service&quot;)\n    @PortName(&quot;my-port&quot;)\n    private String service.\nIf for a multiport service no @PortName qualifier is specified, the first port on the list will be used.\nThe @Path annotation\nIn the same spirit with the @Protocol annotation this extension also supports the @Path annotation, for the cases that we need the injected value to be decorated with a custom path.\n            @Inject\n            @ServiceName(&quot;mysqldb&quot;)\n            @Protocol(&quot;jdbc:mysql&quot;)\n            @Path(&quot;db1&quot;)\n            private String urlForDb1.\n\n            @Inject\n            @ServiceName(&quot;mysqldb&quot;)\n            @Protocol(&quot;jdbc:mysql&quot;)\n            @Path(&quot;db2&quot;)\n            private String urlForDb2.                        \nThe @Endpoint annotation\nThere are cases, where we don&#39;t want to access the Service IP but we want to access and endpoint to the service.\nA very good example are headless service, which doesn&#39;t have a Service IP. You can instruct the framework to use endpoints instead of the Service with the @Endpoint annotation.\n    @Inject\n    @ServiceName(&quot;headless-service&quot;)\n    @Endpoint\n    private String service.\nIf more than one endpoints are available for the service, the first found will be the one injected. But you can access them all by using a List or a Set.\n    @Inject\n    @ServiceName(&quot;headless-service&quot;)\n    @Endpoint\n    private List&lt;String&gt; services.\nIn case of Set or List injection the @Endpoint annotation can also be assumed.        \nRunning inside and outside of Kubernetes\nUnder the covers the code will default to using the MY_SERVICE_SERVICE_HOST and MY_SERVICE_SERVICE_PORT environment variables exposed by kubernetes services to discover the IP and port to use to connect to the service. Kubernetes sets those environment variables automatically when your pod is run inside Kubernetes.\nIf your Java code is running outside of Kubernetes then @ServiceName will use the environment variable KUBERNETES_MASTER to connect to the kubernetes REST API and then use that to discover where the services are. This lets you run the same Java code in a test, in your IDE and inside kubernetes.\nIntegration with OpenShift routes\nIn any case if a Route is available that match the Service we need to inject, the route host will be used instead.\nCurrently route will be used only if @Protocol or @PortName haven&#39;t been explicitly specified and only if OpenShift is available.\nCreating custom objects\nIn most of the cases the user will create a client so that it can consume the service. This can be easily done using the injection point and a manual kubernetes service lookup.\n@Produces\n@ServiceName\npublic MyClient create(InjectionPoint ip) {\n    Service service = ip.getAnnotated().getAnnotation(Service.class);\n    String url = Services.toServiceUrl(service.getId(), service.getProtocol());\n    return new MyClient(url);\n}\nUsing Factories\nThe example above is something that works but it does require boilerplate.\nTo simplify the code Fabric8 provides the @Factory annotation.\n   @Factory\n   @ServiceName\n   public MyClient create(@ServiceName String url) {\n       return new MyClient(url);\n   }\nIntegration with Apache Deltaspike\nIn kubernetes its quite common to pass around configuration via Environment Variables. Outside of kubernetes java developers often use System properties, property files and what not.\nDeltaSpike provides an awesome extension which works great along with the fabric8 extension that allows the user to inject configuration form various sources:\n\nSystem Properties\nEnvironment Variables\nJNDI values\nProperty Files\n\nThe @ConfigProperty annotation\nUsing the @ConfigProperty annotation the user can inject configuration from the sources mentioned above. The lookup is performed in the exact same order provided above.\nIt&#39;s use is pretty straight-forward:\nPutting it all together\nIn most case, when we need to consume a service we need both the coordinates of the service and static configuration data, like thread pool configuration, maximum number of connections etc.\nSo it makes sense when we create the &quot;factory&quot; for our client, to also inject configuration. For example:\n@Inject\n@ConfigProperty(name=&quot;CONNECTION_TIMEOUT&quot;, defaultValue=&quot;10000L&quot;)\nprivate Long timeout; \n\n@Produces\n@ServiceName\npublic MyClient create(@ServiceName url) {\n    return new MyClient(url, timeout);\n}\nBut what happens if we need  to create multiple instances of MyClient each configured differently?\nThe @Configuration annotation\nThe configuration annotation allows you to group a set of configuration properties together as part of a bean and instantiate it with different configuration values, depending the context.\nFor example let&#39;s assume that MyClient which has been used in the previous examples, requires a timeout and a pool size for its configuration. And we need to configure multiple instances of MyClient.\nThe configuration of MyClient can be encapsulated like this:\npublic class MyConfig {\n    private final Integer poolSize;\n    private final Long timeout;\n}\nThe obvious way would be to create 2 classes for MyConfig each using a different set of annotations. The worst part is that then we would also need to create 2 instances of @Produces each consuming a different set of configuration. Which becomes really painful even for a simple example like this.\nThe alternative approach is to use the @Configuration annotation and a simple convention: &quot;For all configuration sets, keys are named the same and use a descriminator prefix&quot;. This would allow use to use a single MyConfig class and only specifiy the descriminator where we need to.\n public class MyConfig {\n     @Inject\n     @ConfigProperty(name=&quot;POOL_SIZE&quot;, defaultValue=&quot;10&quot;)         \n     private final Integer poolSize;\n\n     @Inject\n     @ConfigProperty(name=&quot;CONNECTION_TIMEOUT&quot;, defaultValue=&quot;10000L&quot;)\n     private final Long timeout;\n }\nThe discriminator only needs to be specified at the point where configuration is consumed.\n    @Inject\n    @Configuration(&quot;SERVICE_1&quot;)\n    private MyConfig cfg1;\n\n    @Inject\n    @Configuration(&quot;SERVICE_2&quot;)\n    private MyConfig cfg2;\nCombining @Factory, @ServiceName and @Configuration annotations\nTo further reduce the amount of boilerplate one could use all of the annotations to create generic factories that accepts as parameters service urls and configuration.\npublic class MyFactory {\n    @Factory\n    @ServiceName\n    MyClient create(@ServiceName String url, @Configuration MyConfig cfg) {\n        return MyClient(url, cfg);  \n    }\n}\nThe you can directly inject the client:\n    @Inject\n    @ServiceName(&quot;SERVICE_1&quot;)\n    private MyClient cl1;\n\n    @Inject\n    @ServiceName(&quot;SERVICE_2&quot;)\n    private MyClient cl2;        \nIn this approach the benefit is double as both the configuration and the service url are not needed to be specified in the factory but just to the place where the client is consumed. That makes the factory reusable and reduces the amount of code needed.\nFactories can also make use of the @Protocol and @PortName annotations to set default values for protocol and port name.\npublic class MyDataSourceFactory {\n    @Factory\n    @ServiceName\n    DataSource create(@ServiceName @Protocol(&quot;jdbc:mysql&quot;) @PortName(&quot;mysqld-port&quot;) String url, @Configuration MyConfig cfg) {\n        DataSource ds = null;\n        ...\n        return ds;  \n    }\n}\nIf @Protocol or @PortName are present on the actual injection point to, they will take precedence over what&#39;s found here.    \nInjection of Optional Services\nA common approach for treating with Optional services in CDI is to use Instance injection. For example:\n@Inject\nInstance&lt;MyClient&gt; instance;\n\n...\n\nMyClient client = instance.get();\nThe Fabric8 CDI extension supports instance injection for all kinds of injection including @Factory.\n"},"annotations.html":{"url":"annotations.html","title":"Annotations","body":"Fabric Annotations\nKubernetes supports annotations on any kubernetes resource such as on a replication controller or service which are a great way to add arbitrary metadata.

For more detail see the background on how services work.\nA service uses a label selector to find all the pods running which provide a certain network service on a port. You can add labels to a pod which are just a set of key/value pairs. Then a selector is just a set of key/value pairs used to match pods which have those same key/value pairs.\nEach service is given its own IP address and port which remains constant for the lifetime of the service. So to access the service from inside your application or container you just bind to the IP address and port number for the service. \nNote make sure the services are created before any of your pods which use them; otherwise the service won&#39;t have its IP address defined and you&#39;ll have to restart those pods. \nDiscovering services from your application\nThe simplest way to discover things inside Kubernetes is via DNS which does not require any custom client side code, dependency injection or magic libraries. It also benefits from working with all programming languages and frameworks!\nService discovery via DNS\nFor a service named foo-bar you can just hard code the host name foo-bar in your application code.\ne.g. to access a HTTP URL use http://foo-bar/ or for HTTPS use  https://foo-bar/ (assuming the service is using the port 80 or 443 respectively). \nIf you use a non standard port number, say, 1234, then append that port number to your URL such as http://foo-bar:1234/.\nNote that DNS works in kubernetes by resolving to the service named foo-bar in the namespace of your pods so you don&#39;t have to worry about configuring your application with environment specific configuration or worry about accidentally talking to the production service when in a testing environment!  You can then move your application (its docker image and kubernetes metadata) into any environment and your application works without any changes!\nService discovery via environment variables\nKubernetes uses 2 environment variables to expose the fixed IP address and port that you can use to access the service.\nSo for a service named foo-bar you can use these 2 environment variables to access the service:\n\nFOO_BAR_SERVICE_HOST is the host (IP) address of the service\nFOO_BAR_SERVICE_PORT is the port of the service\n\ne.g. you could access a web site or service via:\nhttp://${FOO_BAR_SERVICE_HOST}:${FOO_BAR_SERVICE_PORT}/\nThe value of the host and port are fixed for the lifetime of the service; so you can just resolve the environment variables on startup and you&#39;re all set!\nUnder the covers Kubernetes will load balance over all the service endpoints for you.\nNote a pod can terminate at any time; so its recommended that any network code should retry requests if a socket fails; then kubernetes will failover to a pod for you.\nDiscovering external services\nYou can use the Kubernetes service discovery mechanism with DNS or environment variables to discover services which are internal and running inside Kubernetes, running in a different namespace or running outside of Kubernetes such as services on the internet, SaaS providers or provisioned by other means etc.\nBasically you just need to create the Service metadata for external services; the difference is you list the actual Endpoints rather than letting Kubernetes discover them by using a pod selector and watching the running pods.\nFor more detail see integrating external services.\nExposing services externally\nKubernetes service discovery is designed for containers running inside the Kubernetes cluster. The host/ports of services and pods typically are only visible to containers running inside the Kubernetes cluster. \nSo for software running outside of a Kubernetes cluster (such as web browsers) to access the services and web applications you need to expose the services externally.\nUsing the command line you can use the Kubernetes or OpenShift commands:\nkubectl expose service cheese\noc expose service cheese\nWhen using helm to install or update applications then any service of type = LoadBalancer are automatically exposed.\nIn addition in OpenShift you can create Route resources directly which provides a haproxy based external load balancer to accessing services.\nIf you use Maven you can also use these goals:\n\nfabric8:apply applies the kubernetes json into a namespace in a kubernetes cluster and by default automatically create any required routes for services\nfabric8:create-routes generates any missing OpenShift Routes for the current services in the current namespace \n\nDiscovery when outside of Kubernetes\nWhen in development its often handy to run your code directly; either inside a docker container or just as a native operating system process; but on your laptop and not inside the kubernetes cluster.\nThough even when developing locally we highly recommend to always run your code in a docker image inside Kubernetes via a vagrant image as then you can be sure you&#39;re really testing your application in docker on the same platform as production together with testing your kubernetes resources too!\nTo mimick DNS service discovery inside Kubernetes you can just add entries in your /etc/hosts file pointing to the host/IP addresses of the services.\nFor environment variables based discovery, its very easy to setup environment variables so your code can discover services in a remote kubernetes cluster while running on your laptop.\nTo try this out see:\n\nfabric8:create-env generates environment variable scripts for Kubernetes services so you can simulate running programs as if they were inside kubernetes\n\nYou can then run or debug Java programs in your IDE or via maven while discoverying and reusing services running in a remote Kubernetes cluster.\nThis is extremely handy in development; though once you&#39;ve commit your changes to your source control we expect your source code to be turned into immutable docker images and run inside a Kubernetes cluster in the usual way.\nSee also\n\nhow services work\nintegrating external services\n\n"},"apps.html":{"url":"apps.html","title":"Apps","body":"Apps (or Kubernetes Application Templates)\nApps (or Kubernetes Application Templates) are a Kubernetes extension proposed by OpenShift 3 to enable a single JSON file to configure various Kubernetes resources (Pods, Replication Controllers, Services). \nSo an App could define some database containers, cache tier and application servers; it represents a typical enterprise or web application (as opposed to a mobile or desktop app).\nHere&#39;s an example template. \nA template is also parameterizable; so that as the template is instantiated by a tool (command line, web console) the user is prompted to enter the parameter values to create the configuration used to generate the pods, replication controllers and services. \nFor example an App could generate an ActiveMQ regional cluster; where the template is parameterised with the region name, it&#39;s service port number and the number of replicas.\nYou can install or upgrade application using the helm command line tool.\n"},"environments.html":{"url":"environments.html","title":"Environments","body":"Working with Environments in Kubernetes\nDevelopers tend to work with multiple environments; production, staging, UAT, regression testing and so forth.

So prod pods only see prod services, test pods only see test services etc.\nSo service discovery takes care of finding the right database, message brokers, remote caches and other services for the environment (namespace) a pod is provisioned in.\nReusing JSON/YAML\nIf you really have to, you can change the kubernetes JSON / YAML on a per environment bases to pass in different environment variables (or even config files mounted into volumes in pods); but the more things are the same between environments, the more likely you really are testing the real stuff in test before production. So if possible; just use service discovery in each environment and leave everything else the same.\nYou can always use a different, say, database pod in testing containing test data; but ideally you’d reuse the same JSON/YAML and images for your application code.\nIncidentally we have an Arquillian integration testing framework for running complete environments as a test case; it spins up a new namespace, creates however many services/pods/replication controllers, uses Arquillian / JUnit to assert things startup and then performs the actual tests (e.g. querying MBeans and stuff) and then tears everything down at the end.\ne.g. here’s an example integration test that runs a message broker, producer and consumer and then asserts that the ActiveMQ consumer starts up properly and the ActiveMQ queues enqueue/dequeue correctly. Pretty neat for about a page of code!\nSo we&#39;d recommend you to try to keep the JSON/YAML the same between environments. One thing that does tend to change between environments is scale. Ideally things would automatically scale; so you use modest sizes in Replication Controllers (e.g. replica size 1); then use per environment auto-scaling to scale things up based on load.\nThen your JSON/YAML and docker images can work in all environments without having to change them per environment and folks can have a completely automated Continuous Delivery mechanism setup between however many environments folks need; safe in the knowledge you are testing the same metadata, configuration and images in each environment.\nIf you do find you need to add some kind of per-environment configuration change, the other option is to put the JSON/YAML in source control and have a branch per environment so you can make environment-specific changes when you absolutely must do (and can then easily diff between environments)\n"},"builds.html":{"url":"builds.html","title":"Builds","body":"Builds\nBuilds are a kubernetes extension in OpenShift 3 which support various mechanisms for building containers via\n\nsupplying pre-built deployment units\nhaving source code in a git repository where a git push kicks off a build of the project artefacts along with creating a docker container\n\n"},"projects.html":{"url":"projects.html","title":"Source Code","body":"Projects\nFabric8 is made up of a number of different modular open source repositories:\nCore\n\nkubernetes-model the Java DTOs for working with kubernetes which are generated from the go source code in kubernetes\nkubernetes-client the minimal Kubernetes Java client for working with the kubernetes REST API\nfabric8 the main java libraries\n\nDevOps\nThe following projects are for Microservices Platform:\n\nfabric8-devops contains the main Microservices Platform applications\nfabric8-console the web console for fabric8\nfabric8-forge contains the main JBoss Forge addons and REST service \njenkins-workflow-library the reusable Jenkins Workflow library\nfabric8-jenkins-workflow-steps the Jenkins Pipeline steps for working with Microservices Platform\nkubernetes-workflow extends Jenkins Pipeline to have native Kubernetes support for creating build slaves using custom pods, images, volumes and secrets\n\niPaaS\nThe following projects are for Fabric8 iPaaS:\n\nfabric8-ipaas contains the main iPaaS applications\nipaas-quickstarts contains the quickstarts and archetypes for the iPaaS\n\nTools\n\ngofabric8 is a go based CLI tool for deploying fabric8\nhelm is a fork of helm for working with OpenShift and Fabric8\n\nSuppport for non-docker\nSome folks have work loads they need to orchestrate on operating systems that don&#39;t yet have production quality docker support (e.g. Windows, AIX, Solaris, HPUX).\n\nkansible lets you orchestrate operating system processes on Windows or any Unix in the same way as you orchestrate your Docker containers with Kubernetes by using Ansible to provision the software onto hosts and Kubernetes to orchestrate the processes and the containers in a single system\n\nAdditional projects\nThe web console uses many different hawtio 2 modules.

In fabric8 1.x we had to do a lot of work to replicate the kinds of things Kubernetes gives us; things like discovery of services, wiring, auto   scaling etc.\nHowever as an end user writing, say, Java applications or using technologies like ActiveMQ, Camel or containers like Karaf, Tomcat, WildFly or Spring Boot things should seem pretty similar; though in many ways things get much simpler now (as discovery, wiring and packaging is now simpler and more standardised).\nThe aim of fabric8 on Kubernetes is still to support any runtime application server or software distribution at all; though docker containers will be the standard mechanism for packaging and running software. The change from 1.x to 2.x does not mean any application servers are no longer supported; it&#39;s the reverse - now any docker image is supported ;).\nHow does it affect my build?\nIf you have been using fabric8 1.x up to now and have maven builds making profiles; all that really changes is how the build gets packaged into containers.\ni.e. your maven builds which create jars, bundles, wars and so forth are all totally valid and supported.\nfabric8 2.x builds just support a different way to automatically turn your deployment units into docker containers for deployment on fabric8.\nIn addition the use of Apps allows you to define replication controllers (to specify how many instances of a container you need) as a single deployment JSON. You can also compose multiple containers together and orchestrate them into a single App JSON file.\nFinally thanks to Services the wiring of your components to their services becomes much simpler; usually it&#39;s just a case of using an environment variable for the service port (with a nice default value).\nArchitecture differences\nService Discovery\nInstead of using a ZooKeeper registry in 1.x to store all service endpoints so that we could inject them into other services using property resolvers; we instead use the Services abstraction in Kubernetes. This means clients of a network service just bind to a fixed port on the local network; there&#39;s no need to have any complex wiring inside the application.\nThis radically simplifies applications. For example any application using ActiveMQ just needs to bind to the localhost and port of the region of the ActiveMQ cluster. For many Camel endpoints, the endpoint just needs to choose which port number maps to the service it needs to bind to for things like databases.\nProfiles versus Apps (Kubernetes Application Templates)\nIn fabric8 1.x we focused on profiles in a wiki which are used to represent configuration and metadata which provides a mechanism to build profiles into a container.\nIn fabric8 2.x we default to using Kubernetes Application Templates to define the kubernetes JSON metadata (Pods, Replication Controllers, Services).\nIn addition to support the ability to modify source or metadata inside a wiki / git repository (e.g. camel routes or Java code) we default to using the Kubernetes source to image extension. i.e. Profiles map to a build which has a git repository; this can be viewed/edited via the wiki, a web based IDE or traditional IDE or editor.\nSo source projects are edited; they result in builds which then generate container images which are then used by deployments.\nAuto Scaling\nIn fabric8 1.x we used requirements we specified on a Profile basis. In 2.x we use Replication Controller definitions in JSON to specify how many instances of a certain pod (container) we need to run.\nPorts\nIn Kubernetes each pod (or container) gets its own IP address; and the internal container ports and external host ports are then constant; making things much easier to use and wire together.\nThis is quite different to using fabric8 1.x where depending on the underlying container provider port allocations were different. e.g. by default host and container ports were dynamically generated; for docker internal container ports were constant but external host ports were dynamic.\nFAQ on V2 changes\nSo does that mean V2 is a completely different product?\nFrom the implementation perspective V2 is a big change but we see this as an evolutionary change for users of fabric8 in V2:\n\nkeeps the same set or runtimes, quickstarts, frameworks, capabilities and console (based on hawtio)\ndelegates the creation of the docker containers down to the Kubernetes REST API (rather than having lots of different container providers and ways to do it that often caused confusion)\nswitching from the V1 Gateway to using Kubernetes Services via the Kubernetes REST API to provide simpler standard approach to the discovery of services in a more Docker-like way.\n\nIn many ways 1.x of fabric8 was a set of quickstarts, runtimes, libraries, a console and a Kubernetes-like layer all combined into a single project (with V1 Gateway being very like Kubernetes Services). So to create containers we have a REST API and CLI.\nSo in 2.x of fabric8 we use the exact same quickstarts, runtimes, libraries and console. The web console is still hawtio; it&#39;s got all the same tooling for ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF, OSGi; it&#39;s got a wiki based on a git repository. The difference is it uses the Kubernetes REST API to create containers (rather than the fabric8 1.x one) and uses the Kubernetes CLI.\nAnother side benefit of V2 is that less wiring Java code is required. e.g. any library using ActiveMQ or the camel-activemq component no longer needs to specify a brokerURL or include custom discovery code; it can just set the AMQ_PORT environment variable to point to the service port for the broker group (e.g. the regional cluster of ActiveMQ required) so that the code connects to localhost and Kubernetes Services does the rest! Note this also works for all programming languages and clients too.\nDoes that mean there is no need to use etcd / ZK clusters in V2?\nKubernetes/OpenShift ships with etcd today and uses that to manage the minions. So a fabric8 cluster may be able to reuse the underlying etcd to do things like master election, partitioning etc.\nThough depending on multi tenant requirements; applications might not be allowed to reuse the same etcd as an Kubernetes/OpenShift  installation. e.g. OpenShift Online with 2 million apps probably isn&#39;t gonna let any user application just read and write lots of data to the global etcd ;).\nSo there will still be a need to provision clusters of etcd or ZooKeeper for use inside an application. Given the use of etcd inside Kubernetes/OpenShift then it might be more typical to create sub-clusters (or have a kind of partitioned etcd cluster).\nThough from the fabric8 project we&#39;re aiming to provide an abstraction layer so when master election / partitionining is required in Java code we can use either etcd or ZK clusters; and can - if allowed - reuse the same underlying etcd cluster.\nIncidentally the V2 way to provision an ensemble of ZooKeeper or etcd cluster is probably going to be via an App which makes it easier to provision; then clients can use Services to connect to it. So V2 should make the creation of ensembles easier and more standardised across the hybrid clouds.\nIs my application server or framework still supported in V2?\nAbsolutely! :) In many ways the move to V2 makes it much easier to support any language, framework or application server as we can reuse all of the Docker ecosystem of images in V2.\nSo nothing is going away. V2 just standardises things to make them easier to consume, describe, support and makes things more reusable. For example, you can take your docker container image anywhere that can run docker and take your App JSON to any Kubernetes environment (like OpenShift Online, OpenShift Enterprise, Google Compute Engine, Azure, VMWare etc.). They&#39;d be easy to port to run natively on any place docker runs too really (e.g. EC2).\n"},"FAQ.html":{"url":"FAQ.html","title":"FAQ","body":"FAQ\nThe FAQ is split into the following sections\n\nGeneral Questions\nJBoss Fuse Questions\nKubernetes Questions\nOpenShift Questions\n\n"},"faqGeneral.html":{"url":"faqGeneral.html","title":"General Questions","body":"General Questions\nWhat is the license?\nfabric8 uses the Apache 2.0 License.\nWhat is it?\nFabric8 is an integrated open source DevOps and Integration Platform which works out of the box on any Kubernetes or OpenShift environment and provides Continuous Delivery, Management, ChatOps and a Chaos Monkey.\nWhat does fabric8 do?\nFabric8 (pronounced fabricate) gives you out of the box services that assist you when building Microservices, monoliths or any application in a linux container (Docker/Rocket) environment and is built on top of Kubernetes.\nWhat value does fabric8 add over OpenShift?\n\nKubernetes provides a Docker based Container As A Service (orchestrates docker containers)\nOpenShift V3 extends Kubernetes to support a full Platform As A Service\nhosting source code in git repositories\nperforming builds and hosting private docker images\nsupporting the git-push style model of kicking off new builds\n\n\nFabric8 is focused on:\nproviding a great Kubernetes Console based on hawtio so you can view all of the kubernetes resources, understand whats going on and see the big picture or zoom inside inside individual containers and link to logs and metrics\nbeing an Integration Platform As A Service and a Java Application Platform As A Service\nadding extra services, tooling &amp; quickstarts to make the Kubernetes platform richer and more powerful for the Java ecosystem via:\nFabric8 Apps to provide reusable logging, metrics and make it easier to consume integration and messaging services\ndeep and rich tooling to make it easy to develop Java applications on Kubernetes/OpenShift such as the Maven Plugin and Forge Addons\nJava libraries for working with kubernetes along with kubernetes and jolokia so its easier to develop Java based tools and services which work well with Kubernetes\nTesting with Arquillian helps you perform integration tests of your apps\nmaking JBoss Middleware reusable appliances with lots of tooling so they are easy to consume in a universal console and platform\n\n\n\n\n\nIs Fabric8 Java centric?\nThe short answer is no ;).\n\nFabric8 Management works with any Docker images on Kubernetes - so its completely language, framework and runtime agnostic. The console has added extra introspection and visualisation for Java docker containers which contain a Jolokia but we hope to add more deep introspection tools for other languages. Certainly you can always use any language, framework or runtime specific diagnostic or visualiation tools on Kubernetes directly\nMicroservices Platform focusses on working with any project with any build mechanism running Docker images on Kubernetes. So any language, framework and runtime is supported with any build tooling. Whether thats using OpenShift&#39;s Source to image build mechanism, or our preferred Continuous Delivery using Jenkins Workflow. \nFabric8 iPaaS (Integration Platform is more Java centric in the sense that integration flows tend to be implemented using Apache Camel which runs inside a Java virtual machine (JVM) but the services that Camel integrates with can be any technology, language, runtime, on premise or SaaS etc.\nFabric8 API Management works with any API implemented in any language or runtime; currently only HTTP based APIs are supported though.\n\nHaving said all that; with the  Fabric8 iPaaS) focus, we have optimised Fabric8 so that folks who do use Java have an optimised experience of working with Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift and Fabric8. Though we hope to continue to improve tooling, management and visualisation for other languages and runtimes too.\nIs Jenkins Workflow Java centric?\nOur preferred tool for Continuous Delivery is to use the Jenkins Workflow plugin with Jenkins.\nJenkins Workflow provides a domain specific language for orchestrating long running build tasks such as building, testing, approving, promoting and deploying steps using the Groovy programming language.\nThe preferred approach to using Jenkins Workflow is to reuse docker images for all your build and testing tools; so that most of the details in your Jenkinsfile tends to be running commands inside docker images. So your CD pipeline definition is usually a list of commands using whatever tools you use (Maven, Grunt, Gulp, Make, bash, python, ruby, whatever) which is completely language, tool and framework agnostic.\nCan Microservices Platform work with my CI server?\nOur preferred tool for Continuous Delivery is to use the Jenkins Workflow plugin with Jenkins.\nHowever this is for orchestrating delivery pipelines which typically involves many tasks such as building, testing, approving, promoting and deploying. How each of those parts work is completely up to you.\nFor example you can reuse your existing CI server (Jenkins, Bamboo, TeamCity or whatever) to build your code then use a Jenkins Workflow pipeline to move the build through environments, orchestrate system tests, soak tests, acceptance tests, approvals, promotions and so forth.\nOur preferred approach is to use Jenkins Workflow pipelines as the core orchestration layer when trying to implement  Continuous Delivery, Continous Deployment or Continous Improvement then for that pipeline to trigger whatever is required to complete the pipeline; whether its one or more builds in an existing CI server, triggering OpenShift Source to Image builds or other existing build or test services then orchestrating those along with approval and promotion through Jenkins workflow. It also then means its easier to get a holistic view of your CD pipelines across all projects; irrespective of how each build or test works or what tools are used to build or test projects etc.\nWhere do I look for the source code?\nFabric8 is comprised of a collection of projects written in Java and Golang and packaged up as Docker containers. The git repos for each of these projects/containers can be found in detail in the project documentation pages \nAre Docker and Kubernetes required to run Fabric8?\nFabric8 is designed to work best on top of Kubernetes and Docker; it means fabric8 will work very well in any environment providing the Kubernetes platform such as RHEL Atomic, OpenShift, Google Compute Engine, Azure etc.\nIs Windows supported\nWe recommend using a linux based system for production; preferably if you want a fully managed platform use Docker and Kubernetes or OpenShift Origin V3.\nWindows is currently only partially supported. Windows users may consider using Docker so that all the fabric8 technologies run inside a linux VM in lightweight containers.\nWhat maven plugin goals are available?\nSee the list of maven plugin goals \nWhat Java versions are supported?\nfabric8&#39;s Java code uses Java 8 but any docker image can use any version of any language, runtime or framework it wishes\nDoes Fabric8 use ZooKeeper runtime registry?\nNo, not anymore. Fabric8 1.x used ZooKeeper to share the runtime information between applications and to discover services. Kubernetes comes with the etcd internally which serves much of the same purpose and has support for the services binding, so Fabric8 v2 doesn&#39;t need ZooKeeper registry anymore for general purpose provisioning of containers and services.\nHowever certain services will still require master slave election and partitioning functionality (such as running clusters of ActiveMQ); where either etcd or Apache ZooKeeper is required. If a Kubernetes environment allows it then fabric8 could reuse the underlying etcd cluster; otherwise an etcd or ZK clusters is required for things like ActiveMQ clustering.\nDoes Fabric8 still use profiles to configure application deployment?\nNo, not anymore. Starting from v2 Fabric8 uses app JSON files (i.e. Kubernetes extension proposed by OpenShift 3)\nto configure deployment of the managed application. More detailed configuration (like properties or YAML files) can be \nadded to the file system of the application&#39;s Docker image.\nIs Git repository still used to store the applications&#39; configuration?\nApplications&#39; configuration isn&#39;t stored in Git repository as it used to be in Fabric8 v1. As Fabric8 v2 doesn&#39;t use \nprofiles (but app templates instead), the Git repository is not needed anymore. You can just store application&#39;s configuration (app file)\nin the Maven project and use the Fabric8 Maven plugin to start the application in Kubernetes\nwithout keeping the configuration in any central repository (like Git).\nHowever keeping app files in Git for easier configuration management is recommended. That&#39;s why fabric8 has integrated with Gogs for on premise git repository hosting.  This comes from the fabric8 DevOps features.\nIs Fabric8 server required to provision applications?\nNo, not anymore. Starting from Fabric8 v2 Kubernetes is responsible for providing the runtime registry for the\nmanaged applications. It means that you don&#39;t have to start any dedicated Fabric8 deamon. Tools like \nFabric8 Maven plugin\nor Hawt.io can connect directly to the Kubernetes and deploy/manage it.\nIf there is no Fabric8 server, how can I use Fabric8 shell?\nFor the Fabric8 v2 development activities, the recommended tool is JBoss Forge with the Fabric8 add-on.\nFor provisioning purposes (like creating containers/services or changing the replica sizes) you can use the Fabric8 add-on or use the shell from OpenShift/Kubernetes.\nKubernetes will be included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and OpenShift V3 and is the standard shell for provisioning any kind of the container.\nDeprecations\nFAB (Fuse Application Bundles) has been deprecated for the 1.2 release and removed from 2.x.\n"},"faqFuse.html":{"url":"faqFuse.html","title":"JBoss Fuse Questions","body":"Questions on JBoss Fuse\nThe upstream fabric8 open source project is now focussed on the 2.x version based on Kubernetes.\nJBoss Fuse versions 6.x includes its own branch of fabric8 1.x using Karaf and ZooKeeper.\nSo for any questions relating to fabric8 inside JBoss Fuse 6.x you are best off using one of these:\n\nJBoss Fuse Forum\nRed Hat Support\n\nYou can also browser the JIRA for JBoss Fuse\nThe JBoss Fuse fork of fabric8 1.x is here: https://github.com/jboss-fuse/fabric8\n"},"faqKubernetes.html":{"url":"faqKubernetes.html","title":"Kubernetes Questions","body":"Kubernetes Questions\nWhat is a Microservice in Kubernetes?\nNote that the term Microservice and Kubernetes Services they are quite different things.\nImplementing a Microservice on Kubernetes typically comprises of:\n\na Pod containing the code and configuration of the Microservice\na Replication Controller to scale the Microservice and keep it running in case of hardware or software failure (including liveness checks to kill dead or hung containers)\na Kubernetes Services to expose the pods as a network host and port which may well also be exposed externally \n\nIn terms of Kubernetes JSON resources; a micro service is a Replication Controller and Service metadata.\nHow do I do service discovery?\nCheck the service discovery docs.\nHow do I do discover external services?\nSee Discovering external services\nHow do I do expose services externally?\nSee Exposing services externally\nHow to discover services when running outside of Kubernetes?\nSee Discovery when outside of Kubernetes\nHow many namespaces should I use?\nNamespaces are a great way in kubernetes to group related pods and services together to get easy service discovery without requiring environment-specific configuration or service linking. They also provide role based authentication (RBAC). \nThe more related apps (pods and services) are in the same namespace, the easier it is for service discovery and the less configuration or service linking you need to do. The flip side is, the more namespaces you have, the easier it is to get finer grained RBAC policies on who can view or change apps in the namespace.\nSo our recommendation is use a namespace for each environment (e.g. Dev, Test, Staging, Production) for each team. You can then define who has what roles in each team; then you can define the environments for each team. \nYou may find that namespaces can be shared across teams (e.g. maybe Staging contains the apps from multiple teams) so use your best judgement. There’s nothing stopping you just having, say, 1 namespace for all your production apps; but given companies often split ‘all of production’ into separate teams who look after different parts; its probably a case where you refactor “production” into separate production teams and they each have their own namespace per environment (they may want a Staging and Production environment for example).\nIn a pure Microservice world, you may have 1 namespace per environment per Microservice; though that might be a bit granular for every environment (you may wish to colocate multiple Microservices in the same namespace). Though even a single Microservice might be a collection of pods and services - whether its cassandra, kafka, riak, elasticsearch or whatever. Really a Microservice just represents a ‘chunk’ of a monolith thats built, released &amp; managed by a separate independent team.\nIf you do go the direction of one Microservice per namespace; you’ll have all the Kubernetes Services you need for your app in your namespace; but they will be remote (implemented typically outside your namespace) so you’ll use external services or service linking to point to the implementations you need (using Endpoints rather than using the usual pod selectors in Kubernetes services\nHow do I browse the Swagger docs?\nYou can browse the Kubernetes REST API using the Swagger Site.\nTo browse the OpenShift Swagger docs for your installation:\n\nopen the swagger JSON URL for your OpenShift master in your browser\nthe URL is https://vagrant.f8:8443/swaggerapi/ for the fabric8 Vagrant image\n\n\nif your browser warns you about the certificate continue\nin chrome: click Advanced then Proceed to vagrant.f8 (unsafe) \n\n\nnow open the Swagger Site and copy the following URL and paste it into the text field at the top of the page to the right of swagger\n\nhttps://vagrant.f8:8443/swaggerapi/\n\nhit return on the keyboard or click the Explore button and profit!\n\n"}}}
